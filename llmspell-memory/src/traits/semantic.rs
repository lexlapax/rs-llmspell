//! Semantic memory trait
//!
//! Semantic memory stores bi-temporal knowledge graphs extracted from episodic memories.
//! Unlike traditional knowledge graphs, bi-temporal graphs track both:
//! - **`event_time`**: When the fact was true in the real world
//! - **`ingestion_time`**: When we learned about the fact
//!
//! This enables temporal queries ("what did we know about X at time T?") and
//! knowledge evolution tracking.
//!
//! # Bi-Temporal Design
//!
//! ```text
//! event_time:     |----[Fact A: true]---->
//! ingestion_time:      ^
//!                      |
//!                 (when we learned)
//! ```
//!
//! # Types
//!
//! Entity and Relationship types are re-exported from `llmspell-graph` to avoid
//! duplication and ensure consistency across the memory system.
