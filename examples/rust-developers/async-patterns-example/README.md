# Async Patterns Example

**Complexity Level:** INTERMEDIATE-ADVANCED  
**Time to Complete:** ~15 seconds compilation + execution  

## Overview

This example demonstrates advanced asynchronous programming patterns with LLMSpell agents and tools. You'll learn how to handle concurrent execution, streaming operations, timeouts, racing conditions, and async pipelines.

## Key Concepts

- **Concurrent Execution** - Running multiple tools simultaneously with `tokio::join!`
- **Streaming Operations** - Processing data streams with concurrency limits
- **Timeout Patterns** - Handling long-running operations with timeouts
- **Select Patterns** - Racing multiple operations with `tokio::select!`
- **Async Pipelines** - Sequential processing stages with concurrent execution

## What You'll Learn

- Performance benefits of concurrent vs sequential execution
- Streaming data processing with backpressure control
- Timeout handling and retry patterns
- First-to-complete racing with select patterns
- Building efficient async processing pipelines

## Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Concurrent Tool Execution
- **Sequential vs Concurrent:** Performance comparison
- **tokio::join!:** Running multiple operations concurrently
- **Performance Metrics:** Measuring speedup from concurrency

### 2. Streaming Operations
- **futures::stream:** Processing data streams
- **Concurrency Control:** Limiting concurrent operations
- **Backpressure:** Handling stream processing limits
- **Early Termination:** Breaking out of streams conditionally

### 3. Timeout Patterns
- **tokio::time::timeout:** Operation timeout handling
- **Retry Logic:** Attempting operations with different timeouts
- **Graceful Degradation:** Handling timeout failures

### 4. Select Patterns (Race Conditions)
- **tokio::select!:** First-to-complete semantics
- **Resource Racing:** Competing for fastest response
- **Winner Selection:** Handling first successful completion

### 5. Async Pipeline Pattern
- **Multi-Stage Processing:** Sequential pipeline stages
- **Concurrent Stages:** Overlapping pipeline execution
- **Performance Analysis:** Pipeline vs sequential timing

## How to Run

```bash
cd async-patterns-example
cargo run
```

## Expected Output

The example demonstrates:
- Concurrent execution with 1.8x+ speedup over sequential
- Stream processing with concurrency limits
- Timeout handling with 1s and 3s timeouts
- Racing 3 tools with fastest-wins semantics
- 3-stage pipeline with overlapping execution

## Performance Insights

- **Concurrent Speedup:** ~1.8x improvement over sequential execution
- **Pipeline Efficiency:** Process multiple items simultaneously through stages
- **Timeout Benefits:** Prevent operations from hanging indefinitely
- **Racing Advantages:** Get fastest response from multiple sources

## Architecture Patterns

- **SlowTool Pattern** - Configurable delay tool for testing async patterns
- **Concurrent Execution** - Parallel processing with tokio primitives
- **Stream Processing** - Handling data flows with concurrency control
- **Pipeline Architecture** - Multi-stage processing with overlap
