# File Organizer v1.0 (Universal Layer)

A simple AI-powered file organization system that solves the universal problem: "My files are a complete mess!" Perfect for anyone who struggles with file chaos and wants immediate organization help.

## Overview

The File Organizer demonstrates:
- **Simple Sequential Workflow**: Scan â†’ Classify â†’ Organize (3 clear steps)
- **3 Simple Agents**: Reduced from complex 8-agent system for universal appeal
- **Immediate Results**: Organization plan in under 5 minutes
- **No Technical Knowledge**: Just run and get organized folders
- **Universal Problem**: File chaos that every computer user experiences

## Universal Appeal Features

### Problem: "My files are a complete mess"
Everyone with a computer faces this - downloads folder chaos, desktop clutter, scattered documents. This app solves it simply.

### Solution: 3-Step AI Organization
1. **Scan**: AI examines your files to understand content
2. **Classify**: Files sorted into clear categories (Documents, Images, Videos, etc.)
3. **Organize**: Folder structure suggested with file placement plan

### Target Users
- Any computer user with file organization problems
- Students with assignment chaos
- Parents with family photo/document clutter  
- Remote workers with scattered project files
- Anyone who feels overwhelmed by digital mess

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Run (No API Keys)
```bash
./target/debug/llmspell run examples/script-users/applications/file-organizer/main.lua
```

### 2. With Configuration
```bash
./target/debug/llmspell -c examples/script-users/applications/file-organizer/config.toml run examples/script-users/applications/file-organizer/main.lua
```

### 3. Debug Mode
```bash
./target/debug/llmspell --debug run examples/script-users/applications/file-organizer/main.lua
```

## NEW: Loop Workflow Support (v2.0) ðŸ”„

### Batch Processing with Loop Workflows
The File Organizer now supports **loop workflows** for processing large directories in batches:

```lua
-- Process files in batches of 10
local workflow = Workflow.builder()
    :name("batch_file_organizer")
    :loop()
    :with_collection(file_list)  -- Or use :with_range() for numeric iteration
    :max_iterations(10)           -- Process max 10 batches
    :add_step({
        name = "process_batch",
        type = "agent",
        agent = "file_classifier"
    })
    :build()
```

### Loop Iterator Options
- **Range**: `:with_range({ start = 1, ["end"] = 100, step = 10 })` - Process files 1-100 in batches of 10
- **Collection**: `:with_collection(file_list)` - Iterate over specific file list
- **Limit**: `:max_iterations(5)` - Safety limit to prevent runaway processing

### Example: Batch Processing 1000 Files
```bash
# Process large directory in batches
./target/debug/llmspell run examples/script-users/applications/file-organizer/main.lua \
  -- --input-dir /tmp/huge-directory --batch-size 50
```

## Simple Architecture

### 3 Simple Agents (Universal Complexity)

| Agent | Purpose | What It Does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **File Scanner** | Content Analysis | Looks at file names and types to understand what you have |
| **Category Classifier** | Smart Sorting | Puts files into clear categories everyone understands |
| **Organization Suggester** | Structure Planning | Creates simple folder structure that makes sense |

### Simple Workflow
```
Sequential: scan â†’ classify â†’ organize
â”œâ”€â”€ Scan Files (Tool: file_operations)
â”œâ”€â”€ Classify Files (Agent: category_classifier) 
â””â”€â”€ Suggest Organization (Agent: organization_suggester)
```

### File Categories
- **Documents**: PDFs, Word docs, text files, presentations
- **Images**: Photos, screenshots, graphics
- **Videos**: Video files, tutorials, recordings
- **Audio**: Music, recordings, podcasts
- **Code**: Programming files, scripts
- **Archive**: ZIP files, backups
- **Other**: Everything else

5. **Clear Categories**: Folders everyone understands

## Technical Architecture (Simplified)

### Crates Used (Core Only)
- `llmspell-core`: Basic agent and workflow types
- `llmspell-agents`: Simple agent creation
- `llmspell-bridge`: Basic Lua integration

### Tools Used (Essential Only)
- `file_operations`: List files, create directories, write plans
- `text_manipulator`: Basic text processing (minimal use)

### State Management: REMOVED
- No `State.get()` patterns (too complex for universal users)
- Direct result access only: `result.outputs.step_name`
- Immediate feedback, no complex persistence

### Workflow Complexity: MINIMAL
- Single sequential workflow (scan â†’ classify â†’ organize)
- No parallel, loop, or conditional complexity
- Linear progression everyone can follow

## Configuration

### Customization Options

Edit `main.lua` for basic settings:
```lua
local config = {
    settings = {
        max_files = 20,  -- Process more files
        categories = {"Documents", "Images", "Videos", "Audio", "Code", "Archive", "Other"}
    }
}
```

### Directory Settings
```lua
files = {
    target_directory = "/your/messy/folder/",      -- Where your mess is
    organized_directory = "/your/organized/folder/", -- Where it goes  
    organization_plan = "/tmp/organization-plan.txt" -- The plan file
}
```

## Output Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/tmp/messy_files/` | Sample messy files (demo) |
| `/tmp/organized_files/` | Organized folder structure |
| `/tmp/organization-plan.txt` | Step-by-step organization guide |
