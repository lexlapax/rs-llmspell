## Power User Architecture

### 4 Specialized Agents (Power User Complexity)

| Agent | Purpose | What It Does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Content Planner** | Strategic Planning | Creates detailed content plans with structure, audience targeting, and goals |
| **Content Writer** | Professional Writing | Generates high-quality content based on structured plans |
| **Content Editor** | Quality Control | Reviews content quality and provides conditional editing decisions |
| **Content Formatter** | Publication Preparation | Formats content for publication with professional presentation |

### Sequential + Parallel Workflow Architecture ✅ WORKING
```
Main Content Creation (Sequential):
├── Plan Content (Agent: content_planner) - 90s timeout
├── Write Draft (Agent: content_writer) - 120s timeout  
└── Format Content (Agent: content_formatter) - 90s timeout

Parallel Quality Checks (Separate workflow):
├── Grammar Check (Agent: content_editor) ──┐
└── SEO Check (Agent: content_formatter) ────┤→ Both execute simultaneously (43ms)
```

**Performance Results**: 
- Main workflow: 16.3 seconds (3 agents sequential)
- Quality checks: 43ms (2 agents parallel)
- Total: ~20 seconds with parallel optimization

### Quality Control Features
- **Parallel Quality Assessment**: Grammar and SEO analysis run simultaneously
- **Professional Formatting**: Publication-ready output with proper structure  
- **Timeout Management**: Proper step timeouts prevent hanging (90-120s per step)
- **Productivity Metrics**: Time savings and quality improvements tracking
- **API Optimization**: Uses both OpenAI and Anthropic providers for reliability
