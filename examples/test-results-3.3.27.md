# Task 3.3.27 Test Results

**Date**: 2025-07-22
**Task**: Comprehensive Example Testing

## Summary

Testing revealed that many examples are using APIs that don't exist yet in the current implementation. This is expected as we're still in Phase 3.3 building the agent infrastructure.

## Test Results

### 1. Core Tests
- ❌ `test-cli.lua` - Failed (exit code 127)
- ❌ `test-globals.lua` - Failed (exit code 127)

### 2. Tool Examples
- ✅ 9 passed
- ❌ 3 failed
- Total: 12 tool examples

### 3. Agent Examples

#### Currently Available Agent API:
- `Agent.create(config)` - ✅ Working
- `Agent.list()` - ✅ Working  
- `agent:execute(params)` - ✅ Working (expects table with `text` field)
- `Agent.discover()` - ❌ Not implemented

#### Agent Examples Status:
- ❌ `agent-composition.lua` - Uses unimplemented methods:
  - `Agent.listCapabilities()`
  - `Agent.getInfo()`
  - `Agent.wrapAsTool()`
  - `Agent.createComposite()`
  - `Agent.listInstances()`
  - `Agent.discoverByCapability()`
  - `Agent.getHierarchy()`

- ❌ `agent-coordinator.lua` - Likely uses unimplemented methods
- ❌ `agent-monitor.lua` - Likely uses unimplemented methods
- ❌ `agent-orchestrator.lua` - Likely uses unimplemented methods
- ❌ `agent-processor.lua` - Likely uses unimplemented methods

- ✅ `agent_creation_test.lua` - Fixed to use `Agent.create()` instead of `Agent.createAsync()`
- ✅ Created `agent-simple-demo.lua` - Working example using only available API

### 4. Workflow Examples

The Workflow API is not yet exposed to Lua, even though implementation exists in Rust:
- ❌ All workflow examples fail with "attempt to call nil value"
- The `WorkflowBridge` exists but isn't registered as a Lua global

## Key Findings

### 1. Agent API Status
- Basic agent creation and execution is working
- Advanced agent features (composition, wrapping, discovery) not yet implemented
- Examples need to be updated to match current API or marked as "future examples"

### 2. API Discrepancies
- Examples use `Agent.createAsync()` but we now have synchronous `Agent.create()`
- Agent execute expects `{text = "prompt"}` not just a string
- Model names need to be exact (e.g., `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` not `claude-3-sonnet`)

### 3. Missing Implementations
- Agent advanced features (composition, tool wrapping, etc.)
- Workflow Lua globals registration
- Agent discovery functionality

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. Update all agent examples to use available API
2. Create separate "future-examples" folder for unimplemented features
3. Register Workflow globals in Lua engine
4. Document current vs planned API clearly

### For Phase 3.3 Completion:
1. Implement missing Agent methods per design doc
2. Complete Workflow Lua integration
3. Update examples progressively as features are added
4. Create migration guide for API changes

## Working Example

Created `agent-simple-demo.lua` that demonstrates all currently working functionality:
```lua
-- Create agent
local agent = Agent.create({
    model = "gpt-4o-mini",
    system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant."
})

-- Execute agent
local response = agent:execute({text = "What is 2 + 2?"})
print(response.text)

-- List agents
local agents = Agent.list()
```

This provides a baseline for testing as we add more features.
