## Deferred Tasks (Future Work)

### Phase 11: Enterprise IDE and Developer Tools Integration

**Status**: Planning Complete  
**Location**: Moved to `docs/in-progress/PHASE11-TODO.md`  
**Timeline**: Weeks 39-40 (10 working days)  
**Dependencies**: Phase 9 (Kernel as Execution Hub), Phase 10 (Memory System)  

**Description**: Comprehensive IDE integration, web client foundation, and remote debugging capabilities leveraging Phase 9's unified kernel architecture. Includes LSP/DAP protocols, VS Code extension, multi-tenant web support, and enterprise security features.

### Kernel Hardening for Production Stability
**Priority**: HIGH (deferred)
**Estimated Time**: 8 hours
**Assignee**: Kernel Team

**Description**: Add panic catching and error recovery to kernel entry points to prevent kernel crashes from propagating and ensure graceful error handling.

**Background**: The kernel should never panic in production. All external module calls (Transport, Protocol, ScriptRuntime, StateManager) should be wrapped with panic catching to convert panics into proper errors.

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Simple panic catching at module boundaries**: Wrap calls to external modules with panic recovery
2. **Graceful shutdown on unrecoverable errors**: If a panic is caught, log error and initiate clean shutdown
3. **Return errors instead of panicking**: Convert all panics to Result<T, Error> at API boundaries

**Key Areas to Harden:**
- Transport layer calls: `recv()`, `send()`, `bind()`, `heartbeat()`
- Protocol handler calls: `handle_request()`, `create_reply()`
- ScriptRuntime calls: `execute()`, `get_variables()`
- StateManager calls: All persistence operations
- Client/Security manager calls: Validation and tracking

**Note**: Async Rust cannot use `std::panic::catch_unwind` directly. Must use `tokio::task::spawn` for panic isolation, which requires careful handling of ownership and Send bounds.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Kernel entry points wrapped with panic catching
- [ ] Panics from external modules converted to errors
- [ ] Graceful shutdown on unrecoverable errors
- [ ] Error logging includes panic source information
- [ ] Tests verify panic recovery behavior

- All subcommands working (kernel, state, session, config, debug)
- --debug flag removed, --trace flag controls logging
- --rag-profile replaces 5 old RAG flags (old flags removed)
- Compilation successful, builds clean
- Manual verification of core functionality
