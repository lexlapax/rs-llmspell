## Overview

**Goal**: Implement persistent state storage with sled/rocksdb backends, hook history persistence, and state replay capabilities that enable production deployments and advanced debugging.

**Megathought Analysis**: Phase 5 represents a critical transition from in-memory ephemeral operations to production-ready persistent systems. This phase leverages Phase 3.3's `llmspell-storage` infrastructure (StorageBackend trait, StorageSerialize) and Phase 4's hook system (ReplayableHook trait, HookContext serialization) to create a comprehensive state management foundation. The implementation must balance performance (minimal overhead), reliability (crash recovery), and developer experience (easy debugging through hook replay). Future phases depend on this foundation: Phase 6 sessions require state boundaries, Phase 16-17 distributed operations need state synchronization, and Phase 18 library mode needs selective state management.

**Enhanced Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Agent state persists across application restarts with zero data loss
- [ ] State serialization/deserialization with backward compatibility guarantees
- [ ] Multiple agents have isolated state with configurable sharing scopes
- [ ] State schema migrations work for version upgrades without data loss
- [ ] Backup/restore operations are atomic and verifiable
- [ ] **Hook history persisted and replayable for debugging and audit trails**
- [ ] **State changes trigger appropriate hooks with performance protection**
- [ ] **Event correlation IDs enable complete timeline reconstruction**
- [ ] **Performance overhead <5% for state operations (enforced)**
- [ ] **Production-ready error recovery and data integrity validation**

**Key Integration Points:**
- Phase 3.3: StorageBackend trait, StorageSerialize trait, sled/rocksdb implementations
- Phase 4: ReplayableHook trait, HookContext serialization, EventCorrelationTracker
- Phase 6 Preparation: Session boundary markers, artifact correlation
- Future Phases: Distributed state sync (16-17), selective initialization (18)
