## ⚠️ CRITICAL MISSING COMPONENTS (Discovered During Implementation)

### Critical Integration Gap
**Problem**: We built llmspell-state-persistence in isolation without integrating it with existing agents and systems.

**Missing Components**:
1. **Agent Integration** - llmspell-agents doesn't depend on or use llmspell-state-persistence
2. **Script API** - No Lua/JavaScript functions to save/load agent state  
3. **Lifecycle Hooks** - pause()/stop() don't save state, resume()/start() don't restore
4. **Registry Integration** - PersistentAgentRegistry uses old storage, not our new system

**Impact**: Our entire state persistence system is currently unusable by agents!

**Immediate Actions Required**:
- [ ] Add llmspell-state-persistence to llmspell-agents dependencies
- [ ] Implement PersistentAgent trait for BasicAgent and LLMAgent
- [ ] Add state save to AgentStateMachine::pause() and ::stop()
- [ ] Create llmspell-bridge/src/globals/state_global.rs with Lua API
- [ ] Update agent methods in lua/globals/agent.rs with save_state/load_state

**Why This Happened**: 
The TODO specified creating files in llmspell-core and llmspell-agents, but we created a new crate (llmspell-state-persistence) to avoid circular dependencies. However, we never went back to integrate this new crate with the existing systems.

**When to Fix**: 
- **NOW**: Agent integration is critical - without it, Phase 5 is incomplete
- **NEXT**: Script API should be done before moving to Phase 5.3
- **LATER**: Registry integration can wait until Phase 5.6 testing

> **📋 Production-Ready State Persistence**: This document implements comprehensive persistent state management with hook integration, preparing the foundation for advanced session management and distributed operations.

---

## Overview

**Goal**: Implement persistent state storage with sled/rocksdb backends, hook history persistence, and state replay capabilities that enable production deployments and advanced debugging.

**Megathought Analysis**: Phase 5 represents a critical transition from in-memory ephemeral operations to production-ready persistent systems. This phase leverages Phase 3.3's `llmspell-storage` infrastructure (StorageBackend trait, StorageSerialize) and Phase 4's hook system (ReplayableHook trait, HookContext serialization) to create a comprehensive state management foundation. The implementation must balance performance (minimal overhead), reliability (crash recovery), and developer experience (easy debugging through hook replay). Future phases depend on this foundation: Phase 6 sessions require state boundaries, Phase 16-17 distributed operations need state synchronization, and Phase 18 library mode needs selective state management.

**Enhanced Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Agent state persists across application restarts with zero data loss
- [ ] State serialization/deserialization with backward compatibility guarantees
- [ ] Multiple agents have isolated state with configurable sharing scopes
- [ ] State schema migrations work for version upgrades without data loss
- [ ] Backup/restore operations are atomic and verifiable
- [ ] **Hook history persisted and replayable for debugging and audit trails**
- [ ] **State changes trigger appropriate hooks with performance protection**
- [ ] **Event correlation IDs enable complete timeline reconstruction**
- [ ] **Performance overhead <5% for state operations (enforced)**
- [ ] **Production-ready error recovery and data integrity validation**

**Key Integration Points:**
- Phase 3.3: StorageBackend trait, StorageSerialize trait, sled/rocksdb implementations
- Phase 4: ReplayableHook trait, HookContext serialization, EventCorrelationTracker
- Phase 6 Preparation: Session boundary markers, artifact correlation
- Future Phases: Distributed state sync (16-17), selective initialization (18)

### Task 5.4.6: Enable Migration API in Standard Global Initialization ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours (Actual: 4 hours)
**Assignee**: Bridge Integration Team
**Completed**: 2025-07-26

**Description**: Enable migration functionality in the standard global initialization path by implementing lazy initialization of migration dependencies following the established patterns. Currently, `StateGlobal::new()` is used in `create_standard_registry()` which doesn't include migration support, making migration APIs unavailable to scripts even though all the infrastructure exists.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Migration functionality requires: StateManager, MigrationEngine, SchemaRegistry, EventBus, EventCorrelationTracker, and HookExecutor
- These dependencies aren't available during `create_standard_registry()` initialization
- StateGlobal has three init methods: `new()`, `with_state_manager()`, and `with_migration_support()`
- Current initialization uses `new()` which creates fallback in-memory state without migration

**Implementation Strategy (following existing patterns):**
1. **Configuration Extension**: Add migration settings to RuntimeConfig
   - Add `state_persistence` section to GlobalRuntimeConfig
   - Include fields: `enabled`, `backend_type`, `migration_enabled`, `schema_directory`
   - Follow existing config patterns (see SecurityConfig, EngineConfigs)

2. **Lazy Initialization Pattern**: Implement get_or_create pattern similar to EventGlobal
   - Create helper function `get_or_create_state_infrastructure()` in state_global.rs
   - Check GlobalContext for existing StateManager/MigrationEngine bridges
   - Initialize infrastructure on first use if config enables it
   - Store bridges in GlobalContext for reuse across globals

3. **Enhanced StateGlobal Creation**: Modify create_standard_registry()
   - Check RuntimeConfig for state persistence settings
   - If enabled, create StateManager with configured backend
   - If migration enabled, create full migration infrastructure
   - Use appropriate StateGlobal constructor based on available components
   - Fallback to basic StateGlobal::new() if not configured

4. **Bridge Storage Pattern**: Use GlobalContext bridge storage
   - Store "state_manager", "migration_engine", "schema_registry" bridges
   - Follow pattern used by HookBridge and EventBridge
   - Enable component sharing across globals and script engines

**Files to Create/Update:**
- **ENHANCE**: `llmspell-bridge/src/runtime.rs` - Add StatePersistenceConfig to GlobalRuntimeConfig
- **ENHANCE**: `llmspell-bridge/src/globals/state_global.rs` - Add lazy initialization helpers
- **ENHANCE**: `llmspell-bridge/src/globals/mod.rs` - Update create_standard_registry() to check config
- **CREATE**: `llmspell-bridge/src/globals/state_infrastructure.rs` - Shared state infrastructure initialization
- **ENHANCE**: `llmspell-cli/src/config.rs` - Add state persistence configuration loading
- **UPDATE**: `examples/lua/migration/schema_migration.lua` - Remove warning about unavailability
- **CREATE**: `llmspell-bridge/tests/state_migration_availability_test.rs` - Test migration API availability

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] RuntimeConfig includes state persistence and migration settings
- [x] StateGlobal automatically initializes with migration support when configured
- [x] Migration APIs (migrate, migration_status, schema_versions) available in Lua when enabled
- [x] Lazy initialization only creates infrastructure when first accessed
- [x] Components shared via GlobalContext bridges to avoid duplication
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained - works without config (fallback mode)
- [x] Performance requirement met - initialization <10ms when not configured
- [x] Examples work without manual StateGlobal creation
- [x] All existing tests pass with no regressions

**Technical Requirements:**
- Follow existing naming conventions: get_or_create_*, with_*, *Config
- Use Arc<T> for shared components stored as bridges
- Implement proper error handling with context-aware messages
- Add debug logging for initialization steps
- Document configuration options in example config files
- Ensure thread-safety for concurrent access

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for config parsing and validation
- Integration test verifying migration APIs available when configured
- Integration test verifying fallback behavior when not configured
- Performance test ensuring <10ms overhead when disabled
- Example script demonstrating configuration-based enablement

**Implementation Summary:**
