## Tool Security Classification

### Safe Tools (SecurityLevel::Safe)
- **UuidGeneratorTool**: UUID generation - minimal risk
- **Base64EncoderTool**: Encoding/decoding - no system access
- **CalculatorTool**: Mathematical expressions - sandboxed
- **DateTimeHandlerTool**: Date/time operations - no external access
- **DiffCalculatorTool**: Text comparison - safe operations
- **DataValidationTool**: Input validation - controlled operations
- **HashCalculatorTool**: Hash computation - safe cryptographic operations
- **TextManipulatorTool**: String manipulation - controlled operations

### Restricted Tools (SecurityLevel::Restricted)
- **TemplateEngineTool**: Template rendering - requires injection protection
- **ProcessExecutorTool**: Command execution - requires sandboxing
- **FileOperationsTool**: File system access - requires path validation
- **SystemMonitorTool**: System information - requires access controls
- **EnvironmentReaderTool**: Environment variables - requires filtering
- **ServiceCheckerTool**: Network connectivity - requires validation
- **HttpRequestTool**: HTTP requests - requires URL validation
- **FileWatcherTool**: File system monitoring - requires path restrictions

## Security Controls Implemented

### 1. Resource Limits
- **Memory Limits**: All tools implement memory usage bounds
- **CPU Limits**: Time-based execution limits prevent DoS
- **Network Limits**: Rate limiting and bandwidth controls
- **File Operation Limits**: Prevent excessive file system usage

### 2. Sandboxing
- **File Sandbox**: Path traversal prevention for file operations
- **Network Sandbox**: URL validation and SSRF protection
- **Process Sandbox**: Command execution restrictions

### 3. Input Validation
- **Parameter Validation**: All tools validate input parameters
- **Path Validation**: File tools prevent directory traversal
- **URL Validation**: Network tools prevent malicious URLs
- **Expression Validation**: Calculator prevents code injection

### 4. Security Requirements
- **Level Classification**: Each tool declares appropriate security level
- **Permission Specification**: Tools specify required permissions
- **Audit Trail**: Security events properly logged

### Automated Security Testing
- **Continuous Integration**: Security tests run on every build
- **Regression Testing**: Prevents security vulnerabilities from being introduced
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover all attack vectors

## Risk Assessment

### No Critical Risks Found
- All tools properly implement security controls
- No uncontrolled system access detected
- Proper sandboxing in place for dangerous operations

### Medium Risk Areas (Mitigated)
1. **Template Engine**: Injection protection implemented
2. **Process Executor**: Sandboxing and command restrictions
3. **File Operations**: Path validation and sandbox containment
4. **Network Operations**: URL validation and SSRF prevention

### Low Risk Areas
- Utility tools have minimal attack surface
- Mathematical operations are self-contained
- Encoding/decoding operations are safe

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Unified Security Framework
- Consistent security level classification across all tools
- Standardized resource limits and requirements
- Common security patterns extracted to llmspell-utils

### 2. Defensive Programming
