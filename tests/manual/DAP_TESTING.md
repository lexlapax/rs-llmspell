# DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) Testing Documentation

## Implementation Status

### What Was Implemented (Task 9.8.13.7)
1. **DAP Bridge Module** (`llmspell-kernel/src/dap_bridge.rs`)
   - Translates DAP protocol messages to ExecutionManager calls
   - Implements 10 core DAP commands as protocol handlers
   - Unit tested for protocol translation

2. **Integration Points**
   - ExecutionManager provides debug state management
   - REPL exposes debug commands (`.locals`, `.stack`, `.break`, etc.)
   - Jupyter protocol supports debug_request/debug_reply messages

### What Was NOT Implemented
1. **DAP Server**
   - No TCP/WebSocket server listening for DAP connections
   - `--dap-port` command-line flag doesn't exist
   - Cannot accept connections from VS Code or other DAP clients

2. **VS Code Integration**
   - VS Code cannot connect (no server)
   - Breakpoints cannot be set from VS Code
   - Debug toolbar doesn't work

## Testing What EXISTS

### Method 1: REPL Debug Commands

The debugging functionality IS fully implemented and can be tested via REPL:

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Start REPL in debug mode
./target/debug/llmspell repl --debug

# In REPL, test debug commands:
> .break test.lua 10        # Set breakpoint at line 10
> .list                      # List all breakpoints
> dofile('test.lua')        # Run script (will pause at breakpoint)
> .locals                    # Show local variables
> .globals                   # Show global variables
> .upvalues                  # Show closure variables
> .stack                     # Show call stack
> .step                      # Step to next line
> .stepin                    # Step into function
> .stepout                    # Step out of function
> .continue                  # Resume execution
> .delete 1                  # Delete breakpoint by ID
```

### Method 2: Test the DAP Bridge Unit Tests

```bash
# Run DAP Bridge unit tests
cargo test -p llmspell-kernel dap_bridge

# Run with output to see protocol translation
cargo test -p llmspell-kernel dap_bridge -- --nocapture
```

### Method 3: Manual Protocol Testing

The DAP Bridge CAN translate protocol messages, even without a server:

```rust
// Example of what the DAP Bridge does internally
let bridge = DAPBridge::new(execution_manager);
let response = bridge.handle_request(json!({
    "type": "request",
    "command": "variables",
    "arguments": { "variablesReference": 1000 }
})).await;
// Returns properly formatted DAP response
```

## What Would Be Needed for VS Code

To enable VS Code debugging, the following would need to be implemented:

1. **TCP/WebSocket Server**
   - Listen on configurable port
   - Accept DAP client connections
   - Handle DAP protocol framing (Content-Length headers)

2. **Message Router**
   - Route incoming DAP messages to DAP Bridge
   - Send DAP Bridge responses back to client
   - Handle multiple concurrent connections

3. **Kernel Integration**
   - Add `--dap-port` flag to kernel
   - Start DAP server alongside Jupyter server
   - Coordinate debug state between protocols

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Currently Testable
- [x] DAP Bridge translates protocol correctly (unit tests pass)
- [x] ExecutionManager maintains debug state
- [x] REPL commands work (`.locals`, `.globals`, `.stack`, etc.)
- [x] Breakpoints pause execution in REPL
- [x] Step commands navigate code in REPL
- [x] Variable inspection works for all types
- [x] Special character variable names handled

### ❌ NOT Testable (Not Implemented)
- [ ] VS Code connection
- [ ] IDE breakpoint setting
- [ ] IDE variable inspection
- [ ] IDE step commands
- [ ] Multiple client connections

## Files for Testing

### Test Script (`tests/manual/test_debug.lua`)
Already created with breakpoint markers and various test cases.

### Test Runner (`tests/manual/test_dap_commands.sh`)
Automated test script for REPL debug commands.

## Conclusion

The DAP Bridge implementation (Task 9.8.13.7) successfully created the protocol translation layer and integrated it with ExecutionManager. However, without an actual DAP server implementation, VS Code cannot connect. All debug functionality is accessible and fully working through the REPL interface.

To complete VS Code integration, a future task would need to implement the DAP server component that listens on a port and bridges network communication to the existing DAP Bridge.
