- allow security flags and configs to be set as environment variables or flags.. -e.g allow write to this directory.
- every script /example code when it was last working should have a version stamp of rust code that it worked with in the header and the last code commit signature.
- all lua bridges should be just wrappers to rust native bridge.. not doing json conversion etc in lua engine. we just fixed workflow bridge to be that way.
- all tool functions should be consistent for two word functions either like-this or like_this, but not both.
- security sandbox - add network access, add process execution access 
- workflow output collection should be rust code.. are there other things that should be rust code based on webapp-creator?
- agent, workflow, tool - BaseAgent, should probably have a save output, save output stream function at the rust level.
- in phase 7 we redid state 
- add postgres vector store backend in llmspell-storage, https://github.com/tensorchord/pgvecto.rs or https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord/ or pgvector
- remove invoke and just use execute in agent.
- debug for scripts not working
- remove custom steps or document it properly
- agent templates - ideally some of the agent templates use rag to embed more correct information for different domains, or even graphs
- ok, wait a minute, isn't the kernel supposed to be in llmspell-engine , why is it in llmspell-cli? 
llmspell-repl? ultrathink about this , analyze and tell me how it ended up there.. look at the entirety
of TODO to figre this out.. andme where it should be. don't change code. think about providing me 
options after mega analysis and research  



 You're absolutely right - llmspell-kernel is the correct name. Here's what needs to change in Task 9.8:

  Critical Discovery: Multiple Crates Depend on llmspell-engine

  - llmspell-cli → llmspell-engine
  - llmspell-repl → llmspell-engine
  - llmspell-config → llmspell-engine
  - llmspell-bridge → llmspell-engine

  Recommended Task Order Changes for 9.8:

  Task 9.8.3 should become: "Clean and Rename llmspell-engine to llmspell-kernel"
  - Delete all custom protocol code FIRST (it's broken anyway)
  - Rename the crate to llmspell-kernel
  - Update all Cargo.toml dependencies
  - This clears the deck for Jupyter implementation

  Task 9.8.4 should become: "Consolidate Kernel Code in llmspell-kernel"
  - Move kernel.rs from llmspell-repl → llmspell-kernel
  - Move bin/kernel.rs from llmspell-repl → llmspell-kernel
  - Remove kernel code from llmspell-repl (keep only client code)
  - Update imports across codebase

  Task 9.8.5 should become: "Implement Jupyter Protocol in llmspell-kernel"
  - Add ZeroMQ and jupyter-protocol dependencies
  - Implement 5 Jupyter channels
  - Replace old protocol handling with Jupyter messages
  - This happens AFTER the rename to avoid duplicate work

  What Needs to Change in TODO.md:

  1. Update Task 9.8.3 from "Migrate to Jupyter" to:
    - "Clean and Rename llmspell-engine to llmspell-kernel"
    - Delete broken protocol code first
    - Rename crate and update all dependencies
  2. Update Task 9.8.4 from "Move Kernel to llmspell-engine" to:
    - "Consolidate Kernel Code in llmspell-kernel"
    - Move kernel implementation from repl crate
    - Clear separation: kernel=execution, repl=client
  3. Update Task 9.8.5 from "Integrate DAP" to:
    - "Implement Jupyter Protocol with ZeroMQ"
    - This includes DAP support via debug messages
    - Happens after crate is renamed and cleaned
  4. Remove Task 9.8.9 (Delete Custom Protocol):
    - This becomes part of 9.8.3 (done before rename)
    - Cleaner to delete broken code before renaming

  Files to Update Across Codebase:

  # Cargo.toml files needing updates:
  - llmspell-cli/Cargo.toml: llmspell-engine → llmspell-kernel
  - llmspell-repl/Cargo.toml: llmspell-engine → llmspell-kernel
  - llmspell-config/Cargo.toml: llmspell-engine → llmspell-kernel
  - llmspell-bridge/Cargo.toml: llmspell-engine → llmspell-kernel
  - Cargo.toml (workspace): llmspell-engine → llmspell-kernel

  # Directory rename:
  mv llmspell-engine/ llmspell-kernel/

  # All Rust imports:
  use llmspell_engine:: → use llmspell_kernel::

  Benefits of This Approach:

  1. Cleaner Architecture: Name matches purpose (kernel IS the execution engine)
  2. Less Rework: Delete broken code before implementing new
  3. Clearer Boundaries: llmspell-kernel (execution), llmspell-repl (client)
  4. Simpler Migration: One clean break instead of gradual changes

  Updated Task Sequence:

  1. ✅ 9.8.1: CLI uses kernel (done)
  2. ✅ 9.8.2: Kernel auto-start (done)
  3. NEW 9.8.3: Clean & rename llmspell-engine → llmspell-kernel
  4. NEW 9.8.4: Consolidate kernel code in llmspell-kernel
  5. NEW 9.8.5: Implement Jupyter protocol in llmspell-kernel
  6. 9.8.6: Session persistence (unchanged)
  7. 9.8.7: Debug completion (unchanged)
  8. 9.8.8: Migration guide (unchanged)
  9. 9.8.9: (merged into 9.8.3)
  10. 9.8.9 (was 9.8.10): Final testing

  This restructuring makes the architectural intent clear: llmspell-kernel is the execution engine that implements the Jupyter
  protocol, while other crates are clients or supporting infrastructure.


I need to provide the specific TODO.md changes the user needs. Let me write out exactly what needs to be updated in Task 9.8.

⏺ Specific Changes Needed in TODO.md Task 9.8:

  Replace current Task 9.8.3 with:
  #### Task 9.8.3: Clean and Rename llmspell-engine to llmspell-kernel
  **Priority**: CRITICAL
  **Estimated Time**: 4 hours
  **Assignee**: Architecture Team

  **Description**: Delete broken custom protocol code and rename crate to reflect its true purpose as the execution kernel.

  **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Delete all custom protocol files from llmspell-engine:
     - src/protocol/*.rs (LRP, LDP, codec, message)
     - src/transport.rs, src/client.rs, src/server.rs
     - src/adapters.rs, src/channels.rs, src/sidecar/
  2. Rename crate directory: `mv llmspell-engine/ llmspell-kernel/`
  3. Update Cargo.toml package name to "llmspell-kernel"
  4. Update all dependencies in:
     - llmspell-cli/Cargo.toml
     - llmspell-repl/Cargo.toml
     - llmspell-config/Cargo.toml
     - llmspell-bridge/Cargo.toml
     - workspace Cargo.toml
  5. Update all imports: `llmspell_engine::` → `llmspell_kernel::`

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] All broken protocol code deleted
  - [ ] Crate renamed to llmspell-kernel
  - [ ] All dependencies updated
  - [ ] Project compiles with new name

  Replace current Task 9.8.4 with:
  #### Task 9.8.4: Consolidate Kernel Code in llmspell-kernel
  **Priority**: CRITICAL
  **Estimated Time**: 3 hours
  **Assignee**: Architecture Team

  **Description**: Move kernel implementation from llmspell-repl to the newly renamed llmspell-kernel crate.

  **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Move `llmspell-repl/src/kernel.rs` → `llmspell-kernel/src/kernel.rs`
  2. Move `llmspell-repl/src/bin/kernel.rs` → `llmspell-kernel/src/bin/kernel.rs`
  3. Move related kernel modules (connection.rs, discovery.rs, security.rs)
  4. Update llmspell-repl to only contain REPL client code
  5. Update imports and module declarations

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Kernel code consolidated in llmspell-kernel
  - [ ] llmspell-repl contains only client code
  - [ ] Clear separation: kernel=execution, repl=client interface
  - [ ] Binary builds from llmspell-kernel

  Replace current Task 9.8.5 with:
  #### Task 9.8.5: Implement Jupyter Protocol with ZeroMQ
  **Priority**: CRITICAL
  **Estimated Time**: 12 hours
  **Assignee**: Protocol Team

  **Description**: Implement Jupyter Messaging Protocol in llmspell-kernel using ZeroMQ transport.

  **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Add dependencies: `zmq = "0.10"`, fork `jupyter-protocol` crate
  2. Implement 5 ZeroMQ channels (shell, iopub, stdin, control, heartbeat)
  3. Implement core Jupyter messages:
     - execute_request/reply
     - kernel_info_request/reply
     - debug_request/reply/event (DAP support)
  4. Create Jupyter connection file format
  5. Test with real Jupyter console

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] ZeroMQ transport working
  - [ ] Core Jupyter messages implemented
  - [ ] DAP tunneled via debug messages
  - [ ] Works with `jupyter console --existing`
  - [ ] No more TCP framing issues

  Delete current Task 9.8.9 (merge into 9.8.3)

  Renumber Task 9.8.10 → 9.8.9

  This approach is cleaner because:
  1. We delete broken code BEFORE renaming (cleaner git history)
  2. The crate name matches its purpose (kernel = execution engine)
  3. Clear task progression: clean → rename → consolidate → implement
  4. Avoids doing work that will be thrown away


 ok befor you make those changes to the TODO.md but it should be as detailed as possible, with filenames to create delete etc. however. 
  llmspell engine also has sidecars, adapters, channels etc.. .. so instead of deleting first, should you create a new crate 
  llmspell-kernel and make make the changes there.. for sidecars, adapters, channels that we created in Phase 9 (in TODO.md somewhere) 
  you need to ultra analyze what happens to those.. tell me that.

⏺ Ultra Analysis: What Happens to Phase 9 Components

  After analyzing the codebase and TODO.md, here's the complete picture:

  Critical Discovery: llmspell-engine Contains Phase 9.5 Components

  In Phase 9.5 (TODO.md lines 4975-5600), we created:
  1. UnifiedProtocolEngine - Central protocol engine
  2. ProtocolAdapter pattern (LRPAdapter, LDPAdapter)
  3. MessageRouter - Intelligent message routing
  4. Sidecar pattern - Service mesh for protocol complexity
  5. ChannelView - Zero-cost channel abstractions
  6. Universal Message - Protocol-agnostic messages

  These were built to support multiple protocols (LRP, LDP, future MCP/LSP/DAP).

  The Fundamental Problem:

  We're migrating to Jupyter protocol which doesn't need most of these abstractions because:
  - Jupyter has its own channel model (5 ZeroMQ sockets)
  - Jupyter doesn't need adapters (single protocol)
  - Jupyter doesn't need universal messages (native message types)
  - Jupyter doesn't need sidecars (ZeroMQ handles transport complexity)

  Two Strategic Options:

  Option A: Create Fresh llmspell-kernel Crate (RECOMMENDED)

  Rationale: Start clean with Jupyter-first architecture

  Steps:
  1. Create new llmspell-kernel crate
  2. Move only what's needed from llmspell-repl:
    - kernel.rs → Core kernel logic
    - connection.rs → Adapt for Jupyter connection files
    - Parts of discovery.rs → Kernel discovery
  3. Keep llmspell-engine for now (deprecate later)
  4. Implement Jupyter protocol directly in llmspell-kernel

  What happens to Phase 9 components:
  - UnifiedProtocolEngine → Not needed (Jupyter has own architecture)
  - Adapters → Not needed (single protocol)
  - Sidecar → Not needed (ZeroMQ handles this)
  - ChannelView → Not needed (Jupyter channels are different)
  - MessageRouter → Not needed (Jupyter has own routing)

  Option B: Salvage llmspell-engine Components

  Steps:
  1. Delete protocol-specific code but keep infrastructure:
    - Keep processor.rs → MessageProcessor trait still useful
    - Keep debug_bridge.rs → Debug infrastructure valuable
    - Transform adapters → Jupyter message handlers
  2. Rename to llmspell-kernel
  3. Retrofit for Jupyter

  What would be salvaged:
  - MessageProcessor → Process Jupyter messages
  - DebugBridge → Handle DAP through Jupyter
  - Transform UnifiedProtocolEngine → JupyterKernel

  Detailed File-by-File Analysis:

  Files to DELETE (not compatible with Jupyter):
  llmspell-engine/src/protocol/lrp.rs      # Custom protocol
  llmspell-engine/src/protocol/ldp.rs      # Custom protocol
  llmspell-engine/src/protocol/codec.rs    # TCP framing (ZeroMQ does this)
  llmspell-engine/src/protocol/message.rs  # Custom messages
  llmspell-engine/src/transport.rs         # TCP transport (use ZeroMQ)
  llmspell-engine/src/client.rs           # Custom client
  llmspell-engine/src/server.rs           # Custom server
  llmspell-engine/src/adapters.rs         # Protocol adapters (single protocol)
  llmspell-engine/src/channels.rs         # Channel views (Jupyter different)
  llmspell-engine/src/sidecar/            # Service mesh (ZeroMQ handles)
  llmspell-engine/src/engine.rs           # UnifiedProtocolEngine (not needed)

  Files to TRANSFORM:
  llmspell-engine/src/processor.rs → Keep, useful for Jupyter message processing
  llmspell-engine/src/debug_bridge.rs → Keep, valuable for DAP integration

  Files to CREATE in new llmspell-kernel:
  llmspell-kernel/src/
    lib.rs                 # Kernel crate root
    kernel.rs              # JupyterKernel implementation
    jupyter_protocol.rs    # Jupyter message types
    zeromq_transport.rs    # ZeroMQ socket management
    connection.rs          # Jupyter connection files
    debug_adapter.rs       # DAP via Jupyter debug messages
    session.rs             # Session state management
    bin/
      llmspell-kernel.rs   # Kernel executable

  My Recommendation: Option A with Clean Start

  Task 9.8.3: Create new llmspell-kernel crate
  cargo new llmspell-kernel --lib

  Task 9.8.4: Implement Jupyter protocol from scratch
  - Add zmq, jupyter-protocol dependencies
  - Clean Jupyter implementation without legacy baggage

  Task 9.8.5: Migrate valuable components
  - Move debug_bridge concepts (not code)
  - Move processor pattern (adapted for Jupyter)

  Task 9.8.6: Deprecate llmspell-engine
  - Keep it working for now (other crates depend on it)
  - Mark as deprecated in Cargo.toml
  - Plan removal after migration complete

  Task 9.8.7: Update dependencies
  - llmspell-cli → llmspell-kernel
  - llmspell-repl → becomes pure client
  - Others can stay with deprecated engine temporarily

  Why Option A is Better:

  1. Clean Architecture: No legacy abstractions polluting Jupyter implementation
  2. Faster Development: No time wasted retrofitting incompatible code
  3. Clear Intent: llmspell-kernel is purpose-built for Jupyter
  4. Easier Debugging: No confusion between old and new patterns
  5. Git History: Clear transition point in history

  The Phase 9.5 UnifiedProtocolEngine was designed for multi-protocol support. Since we're going all-in on Jupyter, those abstractions
  become technical debt. Better to start fresh with Jupyter-first design.
