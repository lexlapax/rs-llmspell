- add postgres vector store backend in llmspell-storage, https://github.com/tensorchord/pgvecto.rs or 
  https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord/ or pgvector

- think about adding diffusion models as a fundamental provider. that means we have to start characterizing providers 
  with additional metadata - type of model - transformer model, diffusion model etc..

- phase 13 readme
ultrathink. analyze code-base and docs. we need to change the public facing information about this project.
-- this is not and should not be considered production ready. it's an experimental platform. 
It's created to paly around with different ideas on AI quickly, hence the focus on scripting language bridges. This allows for
playing and experimenting with concepts around AI (LLMs, transformer models, diffusion models, language, memory, learning),
quickly in scripts, while retainging the ability to extract known / practiced paradigms to native code with Rust.
-- change the tag-line, the tone, and the messaging of the project, in this README.md and other README.md throughout the project
to refect that .. specifically under docs/technical, docs/developer-guide, docs/user-guide
-- make the root README.md succinct about the purpose. make sure to link prominently the docs/ README.md files prominently for
deeper dives. Suggest and change a different hierarchy for documentation if required.
