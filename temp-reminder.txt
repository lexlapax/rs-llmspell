- allow security flags and configs to be set as environment variables or flags.. -e.g allow write to this directory.
- every script /example code when it was last working should have a version stamp of rust code that it worked with in the header and the last code commit signature.
- all lua bridges should be just wrappers to rust native bridge.. not doing json conversion etc in lua engine. we just fixed workflow bridge to be that way.
- all tool functions should be consistent for two word functions either like-this or like_this, but not both.
- security sandbox - add network access, add process execution access 
- workflow output collection should be rust code.. are there other things that should be rust code based on webapp-creator?
- agent, workflow, tool - BaseAgent, should probably have a save output, save output stream function at the rust level.
- in phase 7 we redid state 
- add postgres vector store backend in llmspell-storage, https://github.com/tensorchord/pgvecto.rs or https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord/ or pgvector
- remove invoke and just use execute in agent.
- debug for scripts not working
- remove custom steps or document it properly
- agent templates - ideally some of the agent templates use rag to embed more correct information for different domains, or even graphs
- scriptruntime capture stdin, stdout, stderr



after that, similarly like rust api, ultrathink, now and analyze code because we need to redo the lua api user-guide 
based on what we've added / changed in Phase 9. look at what we have in docs/user-guide/lua/* analyze what's 
there, and analyze what we've accomplished in Phase 9 via docs/in-progress/phase-09-design-doc.md and 
TODO.md and find out what needs to be updated in the lua user guide. do thorough analysis including 
looking at implementation code and update the lua user-guide.
