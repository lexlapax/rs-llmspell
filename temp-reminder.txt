- think about adding diffusion models as a fundamental provider. that means we have to start characterizing providers 
  with additional metadata - type of model - transformer model, diffusion model etc..

- after postgres addition, we should have a profile for postgres usage with local ollama
, rag 

- do we need all the rust examples? 

- README.md - update to use builder instead of create./target/release/llmspell exec '
  local agent = Agent.create({model = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"})
  print(agent:execute({prompt = "Explain Rust ownership in 2 sentences"}).response)
'

- README-DEVEL.md needs to include
  - ripgrep
  - rust-script

  - replace libsql and sqlite with vector search and index with
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso after the vector indexing is ready.


Take into account all the agent spec considerations and guidelines in @docs/rs-aikit-docs/final-agent-spec-recommendation.md, 
the slightly older last attempt at rs-llmspell consolidation at @docs/rs-aikit-docs/rs-llmspell-consolidated-implementationplan.md
and @docs/rs-aikit-docs/rs-llmspell-consolidated-design-doc.md and create a new @docs/rs-aikit-docs/master-architecture-vision.md 
document. Take into account all that has been accomplished in current rs-llmspell implementation as documented in 
@docs/technical/current-architecture.md, @docs/in-progress/implementation-plan.md, @docs/technical/master-architecture-vision.md
and @docs/in-progess/PHASE*DONE.md files as reference.
Make sure that the architecture includes things we have already accomplished, a kernel based architecture leveraging in process or daemon mode
execution with zeromq based messaging, a way to add lua (or javascript) as wrapper for things implemented in rust, 
the config system now needs to accomodate the full agent spec.. .. use sqlite as the default db, with postgres built for scalability, multi-tenancy
from the get go, (the sqlite should have that too - but can default to current user as default tenant). Be very thorough. research on the web 
if you need to. be thorough and make sure you cover all the bases. do not skip any steps. ultrathink.
