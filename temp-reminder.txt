reminders for me
- testing extract and centralize - integration between crates, integration with external within crate, and functional
- examples - separate between real world examples and testing lua 
- why are different workflow patterns not leveraging the workflow traits?

hooks in tools commented out

  I see, so the execute_hook_phase method is where hooks would be executed, but the actual execution is 
  commented out or stubbed. This shows the pattern though - the ToolExecutor has an optional HookExecutor 
  and uses it to execute hooks at various phases.

  the agents package does it right
