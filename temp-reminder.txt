- ultrathink, analyze all code created in phase 13 upto now 13.1 through 13.5 including all subtasks - look at git logs. 
  phase 13 is hardcoding a lot of config references.. they need to be combined into the config objects in llmspell-config 
  and code changed to leverage the config objects add explicit tasks in the upcoming tasks after 13.5 to make sure we 
  add the use of config objects from llmspell-config.

- ultrathink, analyze all code created in phase 13 upto now 13.1 through 13.5 including all subtasks - look at git logs. 
  find where we need to add trace!, debug!, info!, warn!. These macros need to be added to all critical runtime code paths 
  to leverage runtime tracing infrastructure   add explicit tasks in the upcoming tasks after 13.5 to make sure we add 
  the tracing macros to runtime code.


- add postgres vector store backend in llmspell-storage, https://github.com/tensorchord/pgvecto.rs or https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord/ or pgvector
