- allow security flags and configs to be set as environment variables or flags.. -e.g allow write to this directory.
- all lua bridges should be just wrappers to rust native bridge.. not doing json conversion etc in lua engine. we just fixed workflow bridge to be that way.
- all tool functions should be consistent for two word functions either like-this or like_this, but not both.
- security sandbox - add network access, add process execution access 
- workflow output collection should be rust code.. are there other things that should be rust code based on webapp-creator?
- agent, workflow, tool - BaseAgent, should probably have a save output, save output stream function at the rust level.
- in phase 7 we redid state 
- add postgres vector store backend in llmspell-storage, https://github.com/tensorchord/pgvecto.rs or https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord/ or pgvector
- remove invoke and just use execute in agent.
- remove custom steps or document it properly
- agent templates - ideally some of the agent templates use rag to embed more correct information for different domains, or even graphs
