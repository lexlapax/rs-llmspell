- all lua bridges should be just wrappers to rust native bridge.. not doing json conversion etc in lua engine. we just fixed workflow bridge to be that way.
- all tool functions should be consistent for two word functions either like-this or like_this, but not both.
- security sandbox - add network access, add process execution access 

now another thing to think about is how to debug when working with scripts in lua or javascript.. megathink and analyze .. are 
there debug flags we can pass to the runtime from the configs - debug, warn etc , is the llmspell cli set up to do that? are there 
debug , warn statements in the codebase that get activated when the flag is present? can we use debug hooks for llm debugging.. 
mega think about this, look at the entire codebase and think about how we SHOULD do this holistically and present me with options.
What is already in place? what do we need to add? how big are the changes across how many files?
we can't always resort to adding temporary debug statements in code, compiling it, running it , fixing code and finally taking them out.
There has to be a better way, even thinking of things like debugging as a feature for scripts that we can turn on for debug builds and 
turn off for release builds or portions of them off.
