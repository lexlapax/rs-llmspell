## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| macOS 15.7 (ARM64) | ‚úÖ Fully Tested | All features working on Apple Silicon |
| Linux | ‚è≥ Testing Pending | Expected to work, formal testing in progress |
| Windows | ‚è≥ Testing Pending | Expected to work, formal testing in progress |

> **Note**: v0.7.0 has been thoroughly tested on macOS 15.7 (Darwin 24.6.0, ARM64). Linux and Windows testing is in progress. Please report any platform-specific issues.

## Quick Example

```lua
-- Create an agent and use tools
local agent = Agent.create({
    model = "openai/gpt-4",
    system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant"
})

local tool = Tool.get("file_operations")
local content = tool:execute({
    operation = "read",
    path = "data.txt"
})

local response = agent:execute({
    prompt = "Summarize this content: " .. content.output
})

Logger.info("Summary", {result = response.output})
```

### Hook and Event Example (v0.4.0)

```lua
-- Register a hook to monitor agent execution
Hook.register("agent:before_execution", function(context)
    Logger.info("Agent starting", {agent_id = context.agent_id})
    return {continue_execution = true}
end)

-- Subscribe to error events
Event.subscribe("*.error", function(event)
    Alert.send("Error occurred", event.payload)
end)

-- Emit custom events
Event.emit({
    event_type = "custom:analysis_complete",
    payload = {duration_ms = 250, records = 1000}
})
```

### Persistent State Example (v0.5.0)

```lua
-- Save state with automatic persistence
State.save("agent:gpt-4", "conversation_history", messages)

-- Load state with fallback
local config = State.load("global", "app_config") or {theme = "dark"}

-- Backup state before critical operations
local backup_id = State.backup({description = "Before update"})

-- Perform migration
State.migrate({
    from_version = 1,
    to_version = 2,
    transformations = {
        {field = "old_field", transform = "copy", to = "new_field"}
    }
})
```

### Session Management Example (v0.6.0)

```lua
-- Create a session for long-running interactions
local session = Session.create({
    name = "research_session",
    max_duration = 3600  -- 1 hour
})

-- Store artifacts within the session
local artifact_id = Artifact.store(session.id, "analysis_result", {
    summary = "Market analysis complete",
    data = {revenue = 1000000, growth = 0.15}
})

-- Retrieve artifacts later
local artifact = Artifact.get(session.id, artifact_id)

-- Suspend and resume sessions
Session.suspend(session.id)
-- ... later ...
Session.resume(session.id)

-- List all artifacts in a session
local artifacts = Artifact.list(session.id)
```
