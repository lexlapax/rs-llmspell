# LLMSpell Incident Response Plan

## Purpose

This document outlines the incident response procedures for security incidents affecting the LLMSpell system. It provides a structured approach to detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents while minimizing impact and preventing recurrence.

## Incident Response Team

### Core Team Roles

| Role | Responsibilities | Contact |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| Incident Commander | Overall incident coordination | ic@llmspell.org |
| Security Lead | Technical security response | security@llmspell.org |
| Engineering Lead | System remediation | engineering@llmspell.org |
| Communications Lead | Internal/external communications | comms@llmspell.org |
| Legal Counsel | Legal and compliance guidance | legal@llmspell.org |

### Escalation Matrix

```
Severity Level → Team Activation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SEV-1 (Critical) → All roles, executive team
SEV-2 (High)     → Core team, on-call engineer
SEV-3 (Medium)   → Security lead, on-call
SEV-4 (Low)      → On-call engineer
```

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### SEV-1: Critical
- Complete system compromise
- Data breach affecting users
- Active exploitation in production
- Service completely unavailable

#### SEV-2: High
- Partial system compromise
- Potential data exposure
- Critical vulnerability discovered
- Major service degradation

#### SEV-3: Medium
- Limited security impact
- Non-critical vulnerability
- Suspicious activity detected
- Minor service impact

#### SEV-4: Low
- No immediate impact
- Security improvement needed
- Informational finding
- No service impact

### Incident Types

1. **Data Breach**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
2. **System Compromise**: Unauthorized system access or control
3. **Denial of Service**: Service availability impact
4. **Malware**: Malicious code in system
5. **Insider Threat**: Malicious insider activity
6. **Supply Chain**: Third-party compromise

## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection (0-15 minutes)

#### Automatic Detection
- Security monitoring alerts
- Anomaly detection systems
- User reports
- Automated scans

#### Initial Assessment
```bash
# Quick assessment checklist
1. [ ] Verify the incident is real
2. [ ] Determine initial severity
3. [ ] Identify affected systems
4. [ ] Check for ongoing activity
5. [ ] Document initial findings
```

#### Notification
- SEV-1/2: Page incident commander immediately
- SEV-3/4: Create incident ticket, notify on-call

### Phase 2: Containment (15-60 minutes)

#### Short-term Containment
```bash
# Immediate actions to limit damage
1. [ ] Isolate affected systems
2. [ ] Block malicious IPs/domains
3. [ ] Disable compromised accounts
4. [ ] Preserve evidence
5. [ ] Start incident timeline
```

#### Evidence Collection
```bash
# Preserve forensic evidence
- Memory dumps: sudo dmidecode > memory_dump.txt
- Network connections: netstat -an > connections.txt
- Process list: ps aux > processes.txt
- System logs: tar -czf logs.tar.gz /var/log/
- File hashes: find /suspicious/path -type f -exec sha256sum {} \;
```

#### Long-term Containment
- Deploy patches
- Enhance monitoring
- Implement additional controls
- Plan for eradication

### Phase 3: Eradication (1-4 hours)

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. Identify attack vectors
2. Determine initial compromise
3. Map attacker activities
4. Identify all affected systems

#### Removal Actions
```bash
# Remove threats
1. [ ] Remove malware/backdoors
2. [ ] Close vulnerabilities
3. [ ] Reset credentials
4. [ ] Patch systems
5. [ ] Verify clean state
```

### Phase 4: Recovery (2-24 hours)

#### System Restoration
```bash
# Careful restoration process
1. [ ] Restore from clean backups
2. [ ] Rebuild compromised systems
3. [ ] Apply all security patches
4. [ ] Implement additional monitoring
5. [ ] Verify system integrity
```

#### Validation Testing
- Security scans
- Functionality tests
- Performance checks
- User acceptance

### Phase 5: Lessons Learned (1-7 days)

#### Post-Incident Review
- Timeline reconstruction
- Decision evaluation
- Process effectiveness
- Communication review

#### Improvements
- Update response procedures
- Enhance detection capabilities
- Implement preventive controls
- Training requirements
