## Quick Reference Guide

### For System Architects
1. Start with [master-architecture-vision.md](master-architecture-vision.md) for complete system overview
2. Review [security-architecture.md](security-architecture.md) for threat model and defense layers
3. Study [global-injection-architecture.md](global-injection-architecture.md) for runtime architecture

### For Core Contributors  
1. Read [tool-bridge-architecture.md](tool-bridge-architecture.md) for integration patterns
2. Understand [state-architecture.md](state-architecture.md) for workflow coordination
3. Plan future work using [hook-implementation.md](hook-implementation.md)

### For Technical Integrators
1. Focus on [global-injection-architecture.md](global-injection-architecture.md) for API surface
2. Reference [security-architecture.md](security-architecture.md) for compliance requirements
3. Use [tool-bridge-architecture.md](tool-bridge-architecture.md) for custom tool development

## Architecture Principles

### Core Design Philosophy
1. **Bridge-First Design**: Scripts as first-class interfaces, not add-ons
2. **Composition Over Inheritance**: BaseAgent ‚Üí Agent ‚Üí Tool ‚Üí Workflow hierarchy
3. **Security by Design**: Defense-in-depth with multiple validation layers
4. **Performance First**: <10ms tool initialization, async-everywhere architecture
5. **Language Agnostic**: Consistent API across Lua, JavaScript, and future languages

### Technical Patterns
- **Global Injection**: Zero-configuration access to all functionality
- **Async Everywhere**: Non-blocking I/O with efficient resource utilization  
- **State-First Communication**: Shared state for agent/workflow coordination
- **Type-Safe Bridging**: Bidirectional conversion with validation
- **Resource Isolation**: Sandboxing and limits for safe execution
