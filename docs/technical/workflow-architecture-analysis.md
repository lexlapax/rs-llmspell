 After examining the code, I can see fundamental architectural issues that violate the core principle of "compute in Rust,
  configuration in Lua". Let me explain:

  Current Problem

  1. The Workflow Returns Only a Summary String (llmspell-workflows/src/sequential.rs:824)
  Ok(AgentOutput::text(output_text).with_metadata(metadata))
  1. The output_text is just: "Sequential workflow 'doc_workflow' completed successfully. 0 steps succeeded, 0 steps failed. Duration:
   19.149063625s"
  2. Agent Outputs ARE Written to State (correctly with consistent execution_ids thanks to our fix)
    - But the workflow doesn't collect them back
    - The Lua script can't access them because it doesn't have the execution_id
  3. Lua is Doing Too Much Compute (main.lua:108-152, 463-499)
    - Manually trying to extract workflow_id from result
    - Manually retrieving each agent output from state
    - Manually creating directories and files
    - Working around missing functionality

  What's Violating the Core Principle

  The Lua script is forced to be a data retrieval and file generation engine, which should be Rust's job:

  -- Line 108-118: Manual state retrieval logic
  function collect_workflow_outputs(workflow_id, step_names)
      for _, step_name in ipairs(step_names) do
          local key = string.format("workflow:%s:step:%s:output", workflow_id, step_name)
          local output = State.get(key)  -- Manual state access
          ...
      end
  end

  -- Lines 463-499: Manual file operations
  Tool.invoke("file_operations", { operation = "mkdir", path = project_dir })
  generate_file(project_dir .. "/requirements.json", outputs.requirements_analyst)
  generate_file(project_dir .. "/ux-research.json", outputs.ux_researcher)
  -- ... 20+ more manual file generations

  What SHOULD Happen (Following Core Principle)

  1. Rust Layer Should Collect and Return All Outputs

  In sequential.rs, after workflow execution completes:
  // After executing all steps, collect outputs from state
  let mut agent_outputs = HashMap::new();
  for step in &self.steps {
      if let StepType::Agent { agent_id, .. } = &step.step_type {
          let key = format!("workflow:{}:agent:{}:output", execution_id, agent_id);
          if let Some(output) = context.state.read(&key).await? {
              agent_outputs.insert(agent_id.clone(), output);
          }
      }
  }

  // Return rich AgentOutput with all data
  Ok(AgentOutput::structured(serde_json::json!({
      "execution_id": execution_id,
      "success": workflow_result.success,
      "outputs": agent_outputs,  // All agent outputs
      "metadata": {
          "workflow_name": self.name,
          "duration_ms": workflow_result.duration.as_millis(),
          "steps_executed": workflow_result.successful_steps.len(),
      }
  })))

  2. Lua Should Just Configure and Orchestrate

  -- Simple configuration
  local workflow = Workflow.sequential({
      name = "webapp_creator",
      steps = { ... }  -- Just agent configuration
  })

  -- Execute and get rich result
  local result = workflow:execute(input)

  -- Result already contains everything
  if result.success then
      -- Simple high-level orchestration
      WebappGenerator.create_project({
          path = output_dir,
          outputs = result.outputs,  -- All agent outputs already collected
          template = "ecommerce"
      })
  end

  3. Project Generation Should Be a Rust Tool

  Instead of manual file operations in Lua, create a webapp_generator tool in Rust:
  // In llmspell-tools
  pub struct WebappGeneratorTool {
      templates: HashMap<String, ProjectTemplate>,
  }

  impl Tool for WebappGeneratorTool {
      async fn execute(&self, params: Value) -> Result<Value> {
          // Handle all file generation logic in Rust
          // Use templates, create directories, write files
          // Return success/failure status to Lua
      }
  }

  Why This Example Still Isn't Working

  1. Missing execution_id in result - The workflow doesn't expose it
  2. Empty output collection - The workflow returns empty step arrays (line 753)
  3. Manual state retrieval fails - Lua can't get the correct execution_id
  4. File operations fail - The file_operations tool isn't properly registered

  The Fix Required

  Short-term (to make it work now):
  1. Expose execution_id in workflow metadata
  2. Have the workflow collect and return agent outputs

  Long-term (proper architecture):
  1. Move all output collection logic to Rust
  2. Create a WebappGenerator tool in Rust
  3. Simplify Lua to just configuration and high-level orchestration
  4. Make workflow results rich data structures, not text summaries

  This would transform the user experience from "debugging why state retrieval doesn't work" to "configure agents and get a working
  webapp".
