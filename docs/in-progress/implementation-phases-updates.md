## Summary

These updates to implementation-phases.md reflect how the enhanced Phase 4 design:

1. **Reduces implementation time** in 4 phases (5, 8, 15, 20) by ~2.5 weeks total
2. **Enhances capabilities** in 8 phases without extending timelines
3. **Adds critical dependencies** that prevent architectural rework
4. **Future-proofs** the entire system architecture
5. **Guarantees performance** via built-in protection mechanisms

The investment in Phase 4 (2-3 extra days) yields significant returns throughout the implementation roadmap.
