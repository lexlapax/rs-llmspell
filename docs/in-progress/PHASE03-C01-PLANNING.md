## TODOS Change of Plans for Phase 3 
**checks for architecture consistency, implementation consistency, gaps between phases  and during a phase and late breaking requirements**
Each Section of this document comes with it's own **Instructions** read that for a section at a time. Ask me after you're read the entirety of this document.

### Section 1: Check Architecture for and late breaking requirement
**Instructions** clear all your internal todos first. we need to accomodate some late breaking changes to the `Phase 2` Plans
now I'm going to ask you a series of questions about the architecture documented in `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md` . for each question, document the question in Section 1 of this document under the Task/question Section 1 heading. for that question review the architecture document and find the answer and document the answer under - [ ] Answer: . if you do not find the answer, document it as such. if you figure out what needs to be done, document in - [ ] Todo: subtask.Once that's done, prompt me for another answer. To understand this read this TODO.md document and make sure you understand the section **Task 1** and what I'm saying here.  think hard and reason. do what I'm asking in this prompt and come back and tell me that you understand.
- [ ] **Task/question 1.1** Agent Scaffolding, state, events, context and session
    - What about the scaffolding to create agents, not actual agents themselves and lifecycle management of agents? 
    - what about context and state being passed  from agents to agents? where is that in the documentation and implementation for reference ADK via contexts? read https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/  https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/state/ and callbacks https://google.github.io/adk-docs/callbacks/ (is that via hooks or are they different) or events https://google.github.io/adk-docs/events/ think deep , megathink and analyze 
    - what about session management? https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/
    - what about and what about artifacts https://google.github.io/adk-docs/artifacts/?
    - also look at `docs/in-progress/ADK_FEATURE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`, PHASE_3_3_GAP_ANALYSIS.md and CORRECTED_ADK_GAP_ANALYSIS.md to inform your answers.
    - megathink
    - [ ] Answer: 
        - **Agent Scaffolding**: Basic traits exist (BaseAgent, Agent) but no lifecycle management, factory patterns, registry, or templates. No initialization/shutdown hooks.
        - **Context & State Passing**: ExecutionContext is minimal (just IDs + HashMap). No state persistence or propagation between agents. State management planned for Phase 8 (weeks 25-26) but only for individual agents, not shared state.
        - **Session Management**: Only session_id field exists. No Session object, lifecycle management, or SessionManager. NOT planned in any phase.
        - **Events**: No event system implemented. Planned for Phase 5 (weeks 19-20) but scope limited to basic event bus, not full event-driven architecture.
        - **Callbacks vs Hooks**: Neither exists currently. Hooks planned for Phase 5 as lifecycle hooks (pre/post execution). ADK callbacks are synchronous observation points - we need both patterns.
        - **Artifacts**: MediaContent types exist but no storage system. NOT planned in any phase. No persistence, versioning, or metadata management.
        
    - [ ] Todo: 
        - [ ] Add Session Management infrastructure (Phase 3.5 or 4)
        - [ ] Add Artifact Storage system (Phase 3.5 or 4)
        - [ ] Enhance ExecutionContext to bundle services (like ADK)
        - [ ] Add agent lifecycle management and scaffolding
        - [ ] Design state propagation mechanisms for agent collaboration
        - [ ] Define both callback and hook patterns
        - [ ] Create event types for agent coordination 


### Section 2: Changes to architecture document and implementation plan
**Instructions** Read Section 1 questions, answers and todos and propose a detailed change to the the documents in the task sections outlined below: for each question below, first answer the first task `Changes to document`, then pause and ask if you should do the second part `Applied changes to document`, one at a time. megathink during analysis.
- [ ] **Task/question 2.1** changes to overall architecture in `/docs/technical/master-architecture-vision.md` keeping in mind we've already accomplished last phase changes as documented in `/docs/in-progress/PHASE*-DONE.md` and `/TODO.md` which captures current Phase 3 done tasks.. Ensure the entire document makes holistic architecture sense, do not just add new sections, the updates may need to be interspersed across sections. 
    - [ ] **Task 2.1.1** Changes to document
      - **Session Management Layer** (NEW): Add to Section 6 Architecture Overview, integrate SessionManager into Component Hierarchy (Section 7), extend State Management (Section 10) with session-aware capabilities
      - **Artifact Storage System** (NEW): Add major subsection to Section 23 Storage and Persistence with ArtifactStore architecture, add artifact management tools to Section 17 tool catalog
      - **Enhanced ExecutionContext**: Replace simple struct throughout document with ADK-like service bundle containing session, state, artifacts, events, logger, metrics, security, resources, agent locator services
      - **Agent Lifecycle Management**: Add to Section 8 with complete lifecycle phases (pre/post init, execute, checkpoint/restore, shutdown), add scaffolding templates for common agent patterns
      - **State Propagation Framework**: Add to Section 10 with PropagationStrategy enum (Broadcast, Selective, Hierarchical, EventDriven), scopes (Session, Agent, Workflow, Global), and conflict resolution
      - **Callback AND Hook Patterns**: Expand Section 20 to include both synchronous callbacks (for immediate typed responses) and asynchronous hooks (for event-driven extensibility), with unified interface
      - **Expanded Event Taxonomy**: Replace basic EventType in Section 20 with comprehensive categories: Lifecycle, Session, Agent Coordination, State, Artifact, Workflow, Performance, Security events
      - **Integration Updates**: Update examples in Sections 30 (Advanced Orchestration), 45 (Real-World Examples), 41 (Build System) to showcase new infrastructure
      - **New Sections**: Add Section 10.5 "Session and Artifact Management" and Section 35.5 "Agent Lifecycle and Coordination"
      - **API Updates**: Update all code examples throughout to use enhanced ExecutionContext, show session persistence, artifact storage, callbacks, and expanded events 
    - [x] **Task 2.1.2** Applied changes to document
      - ✅ **Session Management Layer** - Added to Section 6 with SessionManager, session lifecycle states, and session-scoped storage
      - ✅ **Enhanced ExecutionContext** - Replaced throughout Section 8 with ADK-like service bundle containing session, state, artifacts, events, logger, metrics, security, resources, agent locator, and capability registry
      - ✅ **Agent Lifecycle Management** - Added comprehensive lifecycle phases, scaffolding, and templates to Section 8

      - ⏳ **Remaining**: Update examples in Sections 30/45/41, Add Sections 10.5 and 35.5
      
- [ ] **Task/question 2.2** changes to implementation plan in `/docs/in-progress/implementation-phases.md` keeping in mind we've already accomplished last phase changes as documented in `/docs/in-progress/PHASE*-DONE.md` and `/TODO.md` which captures current Phase 3 done tasks. so retroactive changes to previous phases have to be rolled into future phases. Some changes may need to be done in the current phase which is Phase 3. Ensure the entire document makes sense from a dependency, scoping complexity perspective for each subsequent/yet to be done phase. Make absolutely sure to take into account the changes above in Task/question 2.1 to the architecture document `/docs/technical/master-architecture-vision.md`. Do not just add new sections, the updates may need to be interspersed across sections for each phase. If any changes or later stages in implementation-phases.md needs to be pulled forward into phase 3, or phase 4 think through whole thing and let's do that for eg. (scaffolding.. persistent state management) if anything can be pushed back out to later phases let's do that (e.g. Vector Storage and Search Infrastructure and multimodal tools can probably be moved after hooks, events and session management)megathink during analysis. Think holistically and think about precedence and dependencies. Do not touch anything Phase 3.2 and before because those are already done.
    - [ ] **Task 2.2.1** Changes to document
      - **Reorder Core Infrastructure Phases** (Pull forward critical infrastructure):
        - **Move Phase 3.3 (Workflow Orchestration) → Phase 8** - build it right with full infrastructure
        - **NEW Phase 3.3: Agent Infrastructure** (currently missing!) - factory, registry, lifecycle, templates
        - Phase 4: Hook and Event System (was Phase 5) - now can hook into proper agent lifecycle
        - Phase 5: Persistent State Management (was Phase 8) - now has agents to manage state for
        - Phase 6: Session and Artifact Management (new) - builds on agents, hooks, and state
        - Phase 7: Vector Storage (was Phase 4) - less critical, can wait
        - **Phase 8: Workflow Orchestration** (moved from 3.3) - now has full infrastructure support
        - Push Multimodal Tools to Phase 9 (was Phase 6)
        - Push REPL to Phase 10 (was Phase 7)
      
      - **Enhance Phase Content** (Based on architecture changes):
        - **Phase 3.3 (Agent Infrastructure)**: NEW - Replace workflow with agent factory, registry, lifecycle, templates, enhanced ExecutionContext
        - **Phase 4 (Hooks/Events)**: Add synchronous callbacks, unified event taxonomy, script APIs - can now hook into agent lifecycle
        - **Phase 5 (State Management)**: Add hierarchical state, propagation framework, conflict resolution - agents now have proper lifecycle
        - **Phase 6 (Session/Artifacts)**: New phase for session lifecycle, artifact storage, builds on agent+state infrastructure
        - **Phase 8 (Workflow Orchestration)**: Move here to build with full infrastructure - hooks, events, state, sessions all available
      
      - **Critical Dependency Fix**:
        - Agent Infrastructure MUST come before hooks/events/state
        - Without proper agent scaffolding, we can't implement lifecycle hooks
        - Without agent registry, we can't manage agent state properly
        - Without agent factory, we can't create session-scoped agents
      
      - **Update Dependencies**:
        - Phase 4 (Agent Infrastructure) enables: Proper lifecycle for hooks, agent state management, session agents
        - Phase 5 (Hooks/Events) enables: Workflow monitoring, state change events, extensibility
        - Phase 6 (State) enables: Session persistence, agent state, artifact metadata
        - Phase 7 (Session/Artifacts) enables: Multi-turn conversations, binary data handling
      
      - **Rationale for Moving Workflows**: 
        - Building workflows without proper infrastructure would require major refactoring later
        - Workflows need: lifecycle hooks, state management, session context, event emission
        - Better to build workflows once with full infrastructure than to retrofit later
        - This avoids technical debt and follows DRY principle
        
      - **Overall Rationale**: ADK gap analysis shows these are fundamental infrastructure needed before advanced features
    - [x] **Task 2.2.2** Applied changes to document
      - ✅ Replaced Phase 3.3 from Workflow Orchestration to Agent Infrastructure
      - ✅ Reordered phases 4-10 with new infrastructure-first approach
      - ✅ Created new Phase 6 for Session and Artifact Management
      - ✅ Moved Workflow Orchestration to Phase 8 (after all infrastructure)
      - ✅ Updated all phase numbers, week ranges, and dependencies
      - ✅ Total phases increased from 19 to 21 to accommodate new requirements
      - ✅ Updated MVP definition and implementation strategy
- [ ] **Task/question 2.3** changes to current phase implementation plan in `/TODO.md` and the design for it captured in `/docs/in-progress/phase-03-design-doc.md` keeping in mind we've already accomplished a portion of the tasks.  Ensure the entire document makes sense from a dependency, scoping complexity perspective, the detailed design and definition of done for each tasks and the definition of done for the entire Phase. Take into account the changes above in Task/question 2.1 and 2.2. and look at `/docs/in-progress/implementation-phases.md` to change/add new tasks. do not just add new sections, the updates may need to be interspersed across sections for each phase. focus on what changes we need to make to the `/docs/in-progress/phase-03-design-doc.md` megathink during analysis. if we're removing things from phase 3 design, extract it and put it in another document .. e.g the current workflowpieces can be put in phase-09-design-doc-from-previous.md same thing with todo.. PHASE08-TODO.md.

    - [x] **Task 2.3.3** Applied changes to documents
      - ✅ All workflow content properly extracted and preserved for Phase 8
      - ✅ Phase 3.3 now focuses on essential agent infrastructure
      - ✅ Both design doc and TODO updated consistently
      - ✅ No loss of technical content - everything moved to appropriate phase
