## TODOS Handoff to Phase 4 
**checks for architecture consistency, implementation consistency, gaps between phases and late breaking requirements**
Each Section of this document comes with it's own **Instructions** read that for a section at a time. Ask me after you're read the entirety of this document.

### Section 1: Check Architecture for and late breaking requirement
**Instructions** clear all your internal todos first. we're ready to transition to `Phase 4`
now I'm going to ask you a series of questions about the architecture documented in `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md` . for each question, document the question in Section 1 of this document. for each question, document the question under the Task/question Section 1 heading. for that question review the architecture document and find the answer and document the answer under - [ ] Answer: . if you do not find the answer, document it as such. if you figure out what needs to be done, document in - [ ] Todo: subtask.Once that's done, prompt me for another answer. To understand this read this TODO.md document and make sure you understand the section **Task 1** and what I'm saying here.  think hard and reason. do what I'm asking in this prompt and come back and tell me that you understand.
- [ ] **Task/question 1.1** Looking `/docs/in-progress/PHASE03_HANDOFF_PACKAGE.md` if we were to move those items as a set of todos for later phases, do you see any changes that need to be incorporated architecturally or is it just a phasing of implementation. 
    - [ ] Answer: 
        - 
        - 
    - [ ] Todo: 
        - [ ] 
        - [ ] 
- [ ] **Task/question 1.2** Looking `/docs/in-progress/implementation-phases.md` if we were to do a couple of things, extract phase 2.5 and merge it with Phase 6: Multimodal Tools Implementation and then move that entire phase to after  Phase 8: Persistent State Management, do you see an architectural problem with dependencies?

### Section 2: Changes to architecture document and implementation plan
**Instructions** Read Section 1 questions, answers and todos and propose a detailed change to the the documents in the task sections outlined below: for each question below, first answer the first task `Changes to document`, then pause and ask if you should do the second part `Applied changes to document`, one at a time.
- [ ] **Task/question 2.1** changes to architecture document `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md`
    - [ ] **Task 2.1.1** Changes to document
        - 
        - 
    - [ ] **Task 2.1.2** Applied changes to document <date>
- [ ] **Task/question 2.2** changes to implementation plan in `/docs/in-progress/implementation-phases.md` keeping in mind we've already accomplished last phase changes as documented in `/docs/in-progress/PHASE*-DONE.md` so retroactive changes to previous phases have to be rolled into future phases. also read `docs/guides/WORKFLOW_STATE_DESIGN.md` and `docs/guides/WORKFLOW_HOOKS_DESIGN.md` to make sure you know the impacts from phase 3. Ensure the entire document makes sense from a dependency, scoping complexity perspective for each subsequent/yet to be done phase. Take into account the changes above in Task/question 2.1. do not just add new sections, the updates may need to be interspersed across sections for each phase.
    - [ ] **Task 2.2.1** Changes to document
        - 
        - 
    - [ ] **Task 2.2.2** Applied changes to document <date>

### Section 3: Transition to next phase
**Instructions** Read Section 1 and section 2 above and complete the following tasks/questions: 
- [ ] **Task/question 3.1** Based on the `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-final-architecture.md`, and the `/docs/in-progress/implemenation-phases.md`,  are you ready to create a very detailed design doc for phase 03 `/docs/in-progress/phase-04-design-doc.md` in the style of `/docs/in-progress/phase-00-design-doc.md` and a todo list `/docs/in-progress/PHASE04-TODO.md` in the style of `/docs/in-progress/PHASE00-TODO.md`? if not what needs to be done? you can also look at output of previous phase `/docs/in-progress/PHASE*-DONE.md`, `/docs/in-progress/PHASE*HANDOFF.md`  to inform your answers and todos. make sure to include relevant portions of the contents of `/docs/in-progress/phase-02.5-design-doc.md` into the phase 3 design doc considerations.
    - [x] Answer: 
        - **Yes, we are ready to create Phase 3 documentation**. All prerequisite information is available:
        - **Templates exist**: phase-00-design-doc.md provides comprehensive design structure, PHASE00-TODO.md shows detailed task breakdown format
        - **Phase 2 is complete**: PHASE02-DONE.md confirms 26 tools implemented with all infrastructure ready
        - **Phase 2.5 content available**: phase-02.5-design-doc.md has 16 external tool specifications to incorporate into Phase 3.1
        - **No blockers**: KNOWN_ISSUES.md shows no impediments to Phase 3 start
        - **Clear structure**: Phase 3 is now 8 weeks with 4 distinct sub-phases (3.0-3.3) as defined in updated implementation-phases.md
        - **Critical priorities identified**: Tool standardization from handoff package, security hardening requirements, migration strategy needs
    - [x] Todo: 
        - [x] Create phase-03-design-doc.md incorporating: tool standardization specs (Phase 3.0), external tools from phase-02.5-design-doc.md (Phase 3.1), security requirements (Phase 3.2), workflow patterns (Phase 3.3)
        - [x] Create PHASE03-TODO.md with 4 sub-phase task breakdowns, each with 2-week deliverables and clear Definition of Done
        - [x] Updated to clean break approach - no migration tools, comprehensive documentation instead
        - [x] Add performance benchmarks and security test requirements from handoff package
        - [x] Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect Phase 3 status
