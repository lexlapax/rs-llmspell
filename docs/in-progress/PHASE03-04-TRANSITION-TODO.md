## TODOS Handoff to Phase 4 
**checks for architecture consistency, implementation consistency, gaps between phases and late breaking requirements**
Each Section of this document comes with it's own **Instructions** read that for a section at a time. Ask me after you're read the entirety of this document.

### Section 1: Check Architecture for and late breaking requirement
**Instructions** clear all your internal todos first. we're ready to transition to `Phase 4`
now I'm going to ask you a series of questions about the architecture documented in `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md` and other documents in `/docs/technical/*.md`. for each question, document the question in Section 1 of this document. for each question, document the question under the Task/question Section 1 heading. for that question review the architecture document and find the answer and document the answer under - [ ] Answer: . if you do not find the answer, document it as such. if you figure out what needs to be done, document in - [ ] Todo: subtask.Once that's done, prompt me for another answer. To understand this read this TODO.md document and make sure you understand the section **Task 1** and what I'm saying here.  think hard and reason. do what I'm asking in this prompt and come back and tell me that you understand.
- [ ] **Task/question 1.1** Looking `/docs/in-progress/PHASE03_HANDOFF_PACKAGE.md` and looking at what we're trying to implement in Phase 4 documented in `/docs/in-progress/implementation-phases.md`  do you see any changes that need to be incorporated architecturally or is it just a phasing of implementation. 
    - [ ] Answer: 
        - After reviewing both documents, Phase 4 is primarily a phasing of implementation - no major architectural changes needed
        - The Phase 3 handoff package confirms all necessary infrastructure is in place:
          - Agent lifecycle hooks already emit events (all state transitions)
          - Tool execution has pre/post execution points ready
          - Workflow patterns have step boundaries and event emission
          - Event emission infrastructure already exists in agents and workflows
        - The architecture document (`/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-final-architecture.md`) already includes comprehensive Hook and Event System design
        - There's also a detailed hook implementation design document (`/docs/technical/hook-implementation.md`) marked as "PLANNED FEATURE" for Phase 4
        - Phase 3 delivers all integration points needed: agent state transitions, tool pre/post execution, workflow boundaries
    - [ ] Todo: 
        - [ ] No architectural changes needed - Phase 4 can proceed with implementation as designed
        - [ ] Leverage existing event emission infrastructure from Phase 3 rather than rebuilding 

### Section 2: Changes to architecture document and implementation plan
**Instructions** Read Section 1 questions, answers and todos and propose a detailed change to the the documents in the task sections outlined below: for each question below, first answer the first task `Changes to document`, then pause and ask if you should do the second part `Applied changes to document`, one at a time.
- [ ] **Task/question 2.1** changes to architecture document `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md`
    - [ ] **Task 2.1.1** Changes to document
        - No changes needed to the architecture document - it already comprehensively covers the Hook and Event System design
        - The document already includes:
          - Complete Hook System architecture with HookPoint enum covering 40+ hook points
          - Event System with EventBus, EventHandler traits, and event patterns
          - Integration patterns showing how hooks and events work together
          - Script integration examples for Lua, JavaScript, and Python
          - Performance considerations (<5% overhead target)
        - The only potential update would be to add a note referencing the implementation status:
          - Add a note in the Hook and Event System section indicating "Implementation in Phase 4"
          - Reference the detailed implementation guide at `/docs/technical/hook-implementation.md`
    - [x] **Task 2.1.2** Applied changes to document 2025-07-24
        - Added implementation status note to Hook and Event System section
        - Referenced the detailed implementation guide at `/docs/technical/hook-implementation.md`
- [ ] **Task/question 2.2** changes to implementation plan in `/docs/in-progress/implementation-phases.md` keeping in mind we've already accomplished last phase changes as documented in `/docs/in-progress/PHASE*-DONE.md` so retroactive changes to previous phases have to be rolled into future phases. also read `docs/technical/*.md` and `docs/developer-guide/*.md` to make sure we accound for major design changes we need to make in phase 4 and beyond. Ensure the entire document makes sense from a dependency, scoping complexity perspective for each subsequent/yet to be done phase. Take into account the changes above in Task/question 2.1. do not just add new sections, the updates may need to be interspersed across sections for each phase.
    - [ ] **Task 2.2.1** Changes to document
        - Phase 4 section is well-defined, but could benefit from these clarifications:
          1. Add note in Phase 4 Components: "Leverage existing event emission infrastructure from Phase 3 (agent state transitions, tool pre/post execution, workflow boundaries)"
          2. Update Success Criteria to be more specific: "Hook execution works for 6 agent states, 34 tools, and 4 workflow patterns"
          3. Add to Testing Requirements: "Performance regression testing from day 1 to ensure <5% overhead"
          4. Clarify in Components: "Unified Event-Driven Hook System to eliminate overlap between hooks and events"
        - Phase 5 dependency reference is correct - it needs Phase 4 for state change notifications
        - Later phases (6-18) remain properly sequenced with no changes needed
        - The 2-week timeline for Phase 4 appears reasonable given existing infrastructure 
    - [x] **Task 2.2.2** Applied changes to document 2025-07-24
        - Added note to leverage existing Phase 3 event emission infrastructure
        - Made success criteria more specific (6 agent states, 34 tools, 4 workflow patterns)
        - Added performance regression testing requirement from day 1
        - Clarified unified Event-Driven Hook System approach

### Section 3: Transition to next phase
**Instructions** Read Section 1 and section 2 above and complete the following tasks/questions: 
- [ ] **Task/question 3.1** Based on the `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-final-architecture.md`, and the `/docs/in-progress/implemenation-phases.md`,  are you ready to create a very detailed design doc for phase 04 `/docs/in-progress/phase-04-design-doc.md` in the style of `/docs/in-progress/phase-00-design-doc.md` and a todo list `/docs/in-progress/PHASE04-TODO.md` in the style of `/docs/in-progress/PHASE00-TODO.md`? if not what needs to be done? you can also look at output of previous phase `/docs/in-progress/PHASE*-DONE.md`, `/docs/in-progress/PHASE*HANDOFF.md`  to inform your answers and todos. make sure to include relevant portions of the contents of `/docs/in-progress/phase-03-design-doc.md` into the considerations. you may and should look at architecture documents in `docs/technical/*.md` and developer documentation in `docs/developer-guide/*.md` to megathink and analyze for answers. make sure to also accomodate `/docs/in-progress/PHASE03_HANDOFF_PACKAGE.md` anything that relates to phase 4.
    - [ ] Answer: 
        - YES, we are ready to create the Phase 4 design doc and TODO list
        - All prerequisites are in place:
          - Complete architecture documented in `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-final-architecture.md` (Hook and Event System section)
          - Detailed implementation guide in `/docs/technical/hook-implementation.md`
          - Phase 3 delivered all integration points (agent states, tool hooks, workflow boundaries)
          - Clear scope in `/docs/in-progress/implementation-phases.md` (updated with our clarifications)
          - Phase 3 handoff package provides specific recommendations and quick wins
        - The design doc should include:
          - Leveraging existing Phase 3 event emission infrastructure
          - Unified Event-Driven Hook System to avoid overlap
          - 20+ hook points across agents, tools, workflows, state, and system
          - Performance targets (<5% overhead) with regression testing
          - Script integration patterns for hook registration
          - Built-in hooks (logging, metrics, debugging)
        - The TODO list should prioritize:
          - Quick wins from handoff package (fix tool invocation parameter issue)
          - Agent lifecycle hooks first (most mature infrastructure)
          - Performance regression testing from day 1
          - Hook batching for high-frequency events
    - [ ] Todo: 
        - [ ] Create `/docs/in-progress/phase-04-design-doc.md` following Phase 0 style
        - [ ] Create `/docs/in-progress/PHASE04-TODO.md` with detailed task breakdown
        - [ ] Include Phase 3 handoff recommendations in the design
        - [ ] Reference existing hook implementation guide
        - [ ] Define clear performance testing strategy
