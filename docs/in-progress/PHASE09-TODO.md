# Phase 9: Adaptive Memory System - TODO List

**Version**: 0.1 (Initial Transfer)  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Status**: Planning  
**Phase**: 9 (Adaptive Memory System)  
**Timeline**: Weeks 30-33 (15 working days)  
**Priority**: HIGH (Advanced Memory Features)  
**Dependencies**: Phase 8 Vector Storage and RAG Foundation âœ…  
**Arch-Document**: docs/technical/master-architecture-vision.md  
**All-Phases-Document**: docs/in-progress/implementation-phases.md  
**Design-Document**: docs/in-progress/phase-09-design-doc.md (To be created)  
**Memory-Architecture**: docs/technical/memory-architecture.md (To be created)  
**This-document**: docs/in-progress/PHASE09-TODO.md

> **ðŸ“‹ IMPORTANT NOTE**: This is a partial TODO list with tasks transferred from Phase 8. This document needs to be fully expanded with all Phase 9 tasks when Phase 9 planning begins.

> **ðŸ”„ Transferred Tasks**: Tasks 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 below were originally numbered 8.11.1 and 8.11.3 in Phase 8 TODO. They were moved here as they belong to Phase 9's memory system implementation rather than Phase 8's storage infrastructure.

- [ ] `llmspell-graph` crate for temporal knowledge graph
- [ ] Episodic memory with vector-based retrieval
- [ ] Semantic memory with entity/relationship extraction
- [ ] Memory consolidation and adaptive management
- [ ] Integration with existing state and session systems
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Documentation and examples complete

## Notes for Future Expansion

When expanding this document for Phase 9 implementation, include:

1. **Phase 9.1: Foundational Episodic Memory (Week 30)**
   - Create `llmspell-memory` crate with core data structures
   - Implement `InteractionLog` and `MemoryItem` types
   - Integrate with `llmspell-events` for interaction capture
   - Asynchronous ingestion pipeline via hooks
   - Basic vector retrieval using Phase 8 infrastructure
   - Memory persistence via `llmspell-storage`

2. **Phase 9.2: Temporal Knowledge Graph Foundation (Weeks 31-32)**
   - Create `llmspell-graph` crate
   - Bi-temporal data model
   - Node/Edge structures with temporal validity
   - Entity resolution and deduplication
   - Graph storage backend implementation

3. **Phase 9.3: Memory Consolidation & Adaptive Management (Week 33)**
   - LLM-driven memory consolidation
   - Forgetting mechanisms and relevance decay
   - Memory compression and summarization
   - Cross-memory retrieval

4. **Performance Requirements**
   - Memory ingestion: <100ms P95
   - Memory retrieval: <50ms P95
   - Graph queries: <200ms for 2-hop traversals
   - Consolidation: Background process with <5% CPU impact

5. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests for all memory operations
   - Integration tests with Phase 8 vector storage
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Multi-tenant isolation validation
   - Memory consistency tests
