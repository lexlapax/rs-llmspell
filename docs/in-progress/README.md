## What This Directory Contains

The in-progress directory serves as the **active development tracking center** for rs-llmspell. This is where we document ongoing work, plan future phases, and track our journey to version 1.0.

### Document Types

- **Phase Completion Documents**: `PHASE*-DONE.md` files documenting completed work
- **Implementation Roadmaps**: Detailed plans for upcoming features
- **Handoff Packages**: Transition documents between development phases
- **TODO Tracking**: Active work items and priorities
- **Design Documents**: Specifications for features under development
- **Gap Analysis**: What's missing and needs implementation

### Active Documents

📋 **Current Phase Tracking**:
- Active phase work and milestones
- Sprint planning and task breakdowns
- Progress metrics and completion status

🎯 **Planning Documents**:
- `implementation-phases.md` - Master roadmap to 1.0
- Phase-specific design documents
- Feature specifications and RFCs

📊 **Status Tracking**:
- Completion percentages by component
- Known issues and blockers
- Risk assessments and mitigation plans

## Using In-Progress Documentation

### For Core Team Members

✅ **Use these documents to:**
- Track current sprint work
- Plan upcoming features
- Document decisions and rationale
- Hand off work between phases
- Coordinate multi-phase features

### For Contributors

✅ **Reference these to:**
- Understand current priorities

### For Users

⚠️ **Be aware that:**
- Features documented here may not be implemented yet
- APIs and designs may change before release
- Timelines are estimates, not commitments
- Some features may be deferred or cancelled

## Document Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: New feature planning starts here
2. **Active Development**: Documents updated during implementation
3. **Completion**: Phase completion documented in `PHASE*-DONE.md`
4. **Archival**: Completed phase docs eventually move to [archives](../archives/)
