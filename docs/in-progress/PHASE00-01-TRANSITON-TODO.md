## TODOS Handoff to Phase 1 
**checks for architecture consistency, implementation consistency, gaps between phases and late breaking requirements**

**now I'm going to ask you a series of questions about the architecture documented in @docs/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md . for each question, document the question in Section 12.3 of Phase 2. for each question, document the question under the Task/question Section 1 heading. for that question review the architecture document and find the answer and document the answer under - [ ] Answer: . if you do not find the answer, document it as such. if you figure out what needs to be done, document in - [ ] Todo: subtask. Once that's done, prompt me for another answer.
