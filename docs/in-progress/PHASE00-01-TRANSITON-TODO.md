## TODOS Handoff to Phase 1 
**checks for architecture consistency, implementation consistency, gaps between phases and late breaking requirements**
Each Section of this document comes with it's own **Instructions** read that for a section at a time. Ask me after you're read the entirety of this document.

### Section 1: Check Architecture for and late breaking requirement
**Instructions** clear all your internal todos first. we're ready to transition to `Phase 1`
now I'm going to ask you a series of questions about the architecture documented in `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md` . for each question, document the question in Section 1 of this document. for each question, document the question under the Task/question Section 1 heading. for that question review the architecture document and find the answer and document the answer under - [ ] Answer: . if you do not find the answer, document it as such. if you figure out what needs to be done, document in - [ ] Todo: subtask.Once that's done, prompt me for another answer. To understand this read this TODO.md document and make sure you understand the section **Task 1** and what I'm saying here.  think hard and reason. do what I'm asking in this prompt and come back and tell me that you understand.
- [ ] **Task/question 1.1** Streaming requirements for llms 
    - Does the architecture allow llms to accomodate streaming requirements for clients?
    - Do the subsequent layers above? core, agent, tools, workflow, and above that engine, cli, repl allow for streaming?
    - do you need to do external research/web research for this question?
    - How does the `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md` need to change? 
    - does the change require changes to what was accomplished in `/doc/in-progress/PHASE00-DONE.md`, what and how so?
    - does the change require changes to subsequent phases as documented in `/doc/in-progress/implementation-phases.md`, what and how so?
    - [x] Answer: **PARTIAL SUPPORT** - The architecture has foundational support for streaming but needs enhancement:
        - **LLM Provider Layer**: ✅ The `rig` crate supports streaming (has a `streaming` module). The architecture defines `stream_complete()` methods in the `ProviderInstance` trait.
        - **Core/Agent Layer**: ⚠️ `BaseAgent` trait currently only has `execute()` method returning `AgentOutput`. No streaming execution methods defined.
        - **Tool Layer**: ❌ Tools have synchronous `call()` interface, no streaming support.
        - **Workflow Layer**: ❌ Workflows process complete agent outputs, no streaming orchestration.
        - **Script Layer**: ⚠️ JavaScript mentions async generators for streaming, but no formal streaming API defined.
        - **CLI/REPL Layer**: ✅ Table shows "Streaming" support planned for CLI integration.
    - [ ] Todo: 
        - [ ] Add `stream_execute()` method to `BaseAgent` trait that returns an async stream of partial outputs
        - [ ] Define `StreamingAgentOutput` type with incremental content chunks
        - [ ] Add `stream_call()` method to `Tool` trait for tools that support streaming
        - [ ] Create `StreamingWorkflow` types that can orchestrate streaming agents
        - [ ] Define streaming bridges for Lua (coroutines) and JavaScript (async generators)
        - [ ] Update CLI/REPL to handle streaming responses with proper display
- [ ] **Task/question 1.2** Multimodal requirements for llms 
    - Does the architecture allow llms to accomodate multimodal content both-ways (as in images, binaries, videos) requirements for clients?
    - Do the subsequent layers above? core, agent, tools, workflow, and above that engine, cli, repl allow for multimodal content?
    - do you need to do external research/web research for this question?
    - How does the `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md` need to change? 
    - does the change require changes to what was accomplished in `/doc/in-progress/PHASE00-DONE.md`, what and how so?
    - does the change require changes to subsequent phases as documented in `/doc/in-progress/implementation-phases.md`, what and how so?
    - [x] Answer: **MINIMAL/NO SUPPORT** - The architecture lacks comprehensive multimodal support:
        - **LLM Provider Layer**: ❌ The `rig` crate focuses on text-only interactions. No native multimodal support found.
        - **Data Types**: ⚠️ `AgentInput`/`AgentOutput` are not explicitly defined in architecture. `ScriptValue` exists but unclear if it supports binary/media.
        - **Core/Agent Layer**: ❌ No multimodal content handling defined. Architecture mentions "Multi-Modal Integration" as a need but doesn't implement it.
        - **Tool Layer**: ⚠️ Some file system tools exist but no image/video processing tools defined.
        - **Script Bridge**: ❌ Type conversion focuses on JSON-serializable data, no binary/media bridges.
        - **Alternative Solutions**: Other Rust crates (mistral.rs, lm.rs) offer multimodal support but would require different provider integration.
    - [ ] Todo: 
        - [ ] Define `MediaContent` enum type supporting text, images, audio, video, binary data
        - [ ] Extend `AgentInput`/`AgentOutput` to include `Vec<MediaContent>` for multimodal data
        - [ ] Create provider abstraction layer that supports both text-only (rig) and multimodal providers
        - [ ] Add media type conversion in script bridges (base64 for Lua/JS, bytes for Python)
        - [ ] Define built-in tools for image/video processing (resize, extract frames, OCR, etc.)
        - [ ] Update CLI/REPL to handle media file inputs and outputs
        - [ ] Consider switching from rig to mistral.rs or creating multi-provider abstraction
- [ ] **Task/question 1.3** System for file utilities for rs-llmspell 
    - Does the architecture need local utilities that is available to other crates in this library as a baseline, or as a building block for the tools package - for e.g. file manipulation tools, system tools (read services, start stop services, date and time, localization, etc), web fetch/download tools, etc
    - Can the the current architecture allow such a local utility package/crate or in existing package crate in this upcoming phase, or phases there after?
    - do you need to do external research/web research for this question?
    - How does the `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md` need to change? 
    - does the change require changes to what was accomplished in `/doc/in-progress/PHASE00-DONE.md`, what and how so?
    - does the change require changes to subsequent phases as documented in `/doc/in-progress/implementation-phases.md`, what and how so?
    - [x] Answer: **PARTIAL SUPPORT** - The architecture has tools but lacks internal utilities:
        - **Tool-Based Utilities**: ✅ 40+ built-in tools including 8 utility tools (file system, date/time, text manipulation, etc.)
        - **Runtime Access**: ✅ Utilities are available as LLM-callable tools that agents can execute
        - **Internal Library**: ❌ No dedicated `llmspell-utils` crate for shared internal functionality
        - **Code Reuse**: ❌ Each crate must implement its own helper functions (file operations, error formatting, etc.)
        - **Common Patterns**: ❌ No shared implementations for logging helpers, path utilities, config parsing, etc.
        - **Architecture Allows**: ✅ The 12-crate workspace can easily accommodate a new utils crate
        - **Phase Timing**: Adding a utils crate would be beneficial early (Phase 1-2) before too much duplication occurs
    - [ ] Todo:
        - [ ] Create `llmspell-utils` crate with common internal utilities (file helpers, string utils, system info)
        - [ ] Move shared functionality from `llmspell-core` that doesn't belong in core traits
        - [ ] Implement builder patterns for common constructs (error building, config parsing)
        - [ ] Add system information utilities (OS detection, environment helpers)
        - [ ] Create file system helpers with proper error handling and path normalization
        - [ ] Add async utilities for common patterns (retry logic, timeout helpers)
        - [ ] Update workspace Cargo.toml to include the new utils crate
        - [ ] Have other crates depend on utils for shared functionality
