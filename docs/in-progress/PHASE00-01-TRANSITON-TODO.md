## TODOS Handoff to Phase 1 
**checks for architecture consistency, implementation consistency, gaps between phases and late breaking requirements**

**Instructions** now I'm going to ask you a series of questions about the architecture documented in `/docs/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md` . for each question, document the question in Section 12.3 of Phase 2. for each question, document the question under the Task/question Section 1 heading. for that question review the architecture document and find the answer and document the answer under - [ ] Answer: . if you do not find the answer, document it as such. if you figure out what needs to be done, document in - [ ] Todo: subtask.Once that's done, prompt me for another answer. To understand this read this TODO.md document and make sure you understand the section **Task 1** and what I'm saying here.  think hard and reason. do what I'm asking in this prompt and come back and tell me that you understand.

### Section 1: Check Architecture for and late breaking requirement
- [ ] **Task/question 1.1** Streaming requirements for llms 
    - Does the architecture allow llms to accomodate streaming requirements for clients?
    - Do the subsequent layers above? core, agent, tools, workflow, and above that engine, ccli, repl allow for streaming?
    - do you need to do external research/web research for this question?
    - How does the `/docs/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md` need to change? 
    - does the change require changes to what was accomplished in `/doc/in-progress/PHASE00-DONE.md`, what and how so?
    - does the change require changes to subsequent phases as documented in `/doc/in-progress/implementation-phases.md`, what and how so?
    - [ ] Answer: 
    - [ ] Todo: 
        - [ ]
        - [ ]
- [ ] **Task/question 1.3** Multimodal requirements for llms 
    - Does the architecture allow llms to accomodate multimodal content both-ways (as in images, binaries, videos) requirements for clients?
    - Do the subsequent layers above? core, agent, tools, workflow, and above that engine, ccli, repl allow for multimodal content?
    - do you need to do external research/web research for this question?
    - How does the `docs/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md` need to change? 
    - does the change require changes to what was accomplished in `doc/in-progress/PHASE00-DONE.md`, what and how so?
    - does the change require changes to subsequent phases as documented in `doc/in-progress/implementation-phases.md`, what and how so?
    - [ ] Answer: 
    - [ ] Todo: 
        - [ ]
        - [ ]
### Section 2: Transition to next phase
- [ ] **Task/question 2.1** Based on the `/docs/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md`, and the `/doc/in-progress/implemenation-phases.md`, are you ready to create a detailed design doc for phase 01 `/doc/in-progress/phase-01-design-doc.md` and a todo list `/doc/in-progress/PHASE01-TODO.md` in the style of `/doc/in-progress/phase-00-design-doc.md` and `/doc/in-progress/PHASE00-TODO.md`? if not what needs to be done? you can also look at output of previous phase `/doc/in-progress/PHASE00-TODO-DONE.md`, `/docs/in-progress/PHASE01_HANDOFF_PACKAGE.md` and `/docs/in-progress/PHASE01_KNOWLEDGE_TRANSFER.md` to inform your answers and todos.
