## TODOS Handoff to Phase 3 
**checks for architecture consistency, implementation consistency, gaps between phases and late breaking requirements**
Each Section of this document comes with it's own **Instructions** read that for a section at a time. Ask me after you're read the entirety of this document.

### Section 1: Check Architecture for and late breaking requirement
**Instructions** clear all your internal todos first. we're ready to transition to `Phase 3`
now I'm going to ask you a series of questions about the architecture documented in `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md` . for each question, document the question in Section 1 of this document. for each question, document the question under the Task/question Section 1 heading. for that question review the architecture document and find the answer and document the answer under - [ ] Answer: . if you do not find the answer, document it as such. if you figure out what needs to be done, document in - [ ] Todo: subtask.Once that's done, prompt me for another answer. To understand this read this TODO.md document and make sure you understand the section **Task 1** and what I'm saying here.  think hard and reason. do what I'm asking in this prompt and come back and tell me that you understand.

### Section 2: Changes to architecture document and implementation plan
**Instructions** Read Section 1 questions, answers and todos and propose a detailed change to the the documents in the task sections outlined below: for each question below, first answer the first task `Changes to document`, then pause and ask if you should do the second part `Applied changes to document`, one at a time.
- [ ] **Task/question 2.1** changes to overall architecture in `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-final-architecture.md` keeping in mind we've already accomplished last phase changes as documented in `/docs/in-progress/PHASE*-DONE.md`. Ensure the entire document makes holistic architecture sense, do not just add new sections, the updates may need to be interspersed across sections.
    - [ ] **Task 2.1.1** Changes to document
        - 
        - 
    - [ ] **Task 2.1.2** Applied changes to document <date>
- [ ] **Task/question 2.2** changes to implementation plan in `/docs/in-progress/implementation-phases.md` keeping in mind we've already accomplished last phase changes as documented in `/docs/in-progress/PHASE*-DONE.md` so retroactive changes to previous phases have to be rolled into future phases. Ensure the entire document makes sense from a dependency, scoping complexity perspective for each subsequent/yet to be done phase. Take into account the changes above in Task/question 2.1. do not just add new sections, the updates may need to be interspersed across sections for each phase.
    - [ ] **Task 2.2.1** Changes to document
        - 
        - 
    - [ ] **Task 2.2.2** Applied changes to document <date>


### Section 3: Transition to next phase
**Instructions** Read Section 1 and section 2 above and complete the following tasks/questions: 
- [x] **Task/question 3.1** Based on the `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-final-architecture.md`, and the `/docs/in-progress/implemenation-phases.md`, and the `/docs/in-progress/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` are you ready to create a detailed design doc for phase 02 `/docs/in-progress/phase-03-design-doc.md` in the style of `/docs/in-progress/phase-00-design-doc.md` and a todo list `/docs/in-progress/PHASE03-TODO.md` in the style of `/docs/in-progress/PHASE00-TODO.md`? if not what needs to be done? you can also look at output of previous phase `/docs/in-progress/PHASE*-DONE.md`, `/docs/in-progress/PHASE*HANDOFF.md`  to inform your answers and todos.
