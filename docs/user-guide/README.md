    model = "gpt-4"
})

local result = agent:complete("Hello, world!")
print(result)
```

- rs-llmspell installed and configured

## üéØ Common Use Cases

### Text Processing
```lua
local agent = Agent.create({provider = "openai", model = "gpt-4"})
local summary = agent:complete("Summarize this text: " .. long_text)
```

### Data Pipeline
```lua
local workflow = Workflow.sequential({
    name = "data_processor",
    steps = {
        {name = "fetch", tool = "http_client", input = {url = api_url}},
        {name = "parse", tool = "json_parser", input = "$fetch.output"},
        {name = "analyze", agent = agent, prompt = "Analyze: $parse.output"}
    }
})
local results = workflow:execute()
```

### Tool Discovery
```lua
local tools = Tool.list()
for _, tool in ipairs(tools) do
    print(tool.name .. ": " .. tool.description)
end
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

rs-llmspell includes **34 built-in tools** across 9 categories:
- File operations (read, write, search)
- Network tools (HTTP, webhooks, scrapers)
- Data processing (JSON, CSV, text)
- System utilities (process execution, environment)
- And many more!

Use `Tool.list()` to discover all available tools and their capabilities.
