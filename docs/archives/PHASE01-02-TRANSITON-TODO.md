## TODOS Handoff to Phase 2 
**checks for architecture consistency, implementation consistency, gaps between phases and late breaking requirements**
Each Section of this document comes with it's own **Instructions** read that for a section at a time. Ask me after you're read the entirety of this document.

### Section 1: Check Architecture for and late breaking requirement
**Instructions** clear all your internal todos first. we're ready to transition to `Phase 2`
now I'm going to ask you a series of questions about the architecture documented in `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md` . for each question, document the question in Section 1 of this document. for each question, document the question under the Task/question Section 1 heading. for that question review the architecture document and find the answer and document the answer under - [ ] Answer: . if you do not find the answer, document it as such. if you figure out what needs to be done, document in - [ ] Todo: subtask.Once that's done, prompt me for another answer. To understand this read this TODO.md document and make sure you understand the section **Task 1** and what I'm saying here.  think hard and reason. do what I'm asking in this prompt and come back and tell me that you understand.
- [x] **Task/question 1.1** convenience model names in provider calls
    - Does the architecture allow scripts to call llms with short naming syntax `providername/modelname` and base_url overrides? e.g. 
            ```Lua
            local agent = Agent.new({
                name = "research_assistant",
                model = "openai/llama3.5"
                base_url = "http://localhost:11434"
            })``` where provider=openai and model=llama3.5, and base_url="http://localhost:11434" 
            or 
            ```Lua
            local agent = Agent.new({
                name = "collater",
                model = "openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528"
                base_url = "http://localhost:11434"
            })``` where provider=openrouter and model=deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528, and base_url="http://localhost:11434" 
        where the provider is automatically derived from the model name? if not what needs to happen to change that behaviour? should it be done at the llm or the provider abstraction layer so that it propagates all the way back out?
    - Do the subsequent layers above? core, agent, tools, workflow, and above that engine, cli, repl allow this?
    - do you need to do external research/web research for this question?
    - How does the `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md` need to change? 
    - does the change require changes to what was accomplished in `/doc/in-progress/PHASE*-DONE.md`, what and how so?
    - does the change require changes to subsequent phases as documented in `/doc/in-progress/implementation-phases.md`, what and how so?
    - [x] Answer: 
        - The current architecture does NOT support the `providername/modelname` syntax. Models are specified with separate `provider` and `model` fields.
        - Current syntax: `Agent.new("name", { provider = "openai", model = "gpt-4" })` NOT `model = "openai/gpt-4"`
        - Base URLs are configured per provider in configuration files, not passed directly in agent creation
        - The provider abstraction layer (ProviderManager) expects provider and model to be separate
        - All layers (core, agent, tools, workflow, engine, cli) follow this separated pattern
        - External research not needed - the architecture document is clear on this pattern
        - Architecture changes needed: Add model string parsing in the provider abstraction layer to support `provider/model` syntax
        - Phase 1 changes needed: The provider integration (Task 1.3) would need updates to parse model strings
        - Future phases affected: Phase 2 (Advanced Agents) and Phase 8 (Production Deployment) may need updates for this syntax
    - [x] Todo: 
        - [x] Add model string parser to ProviderManager to extract provider from "provider/model" format
        - [x] Update Agent creation API to accept either format (backward compatible)
        - [x] Allow base_url override in agent configuration object
        - [x] Update all script examples in architecture to show both syntaxes
        - [x] Ensure CLI and REPL support the convenience syntax 
- [x] **Task/question 1.2** developer facing apis for lua
    - Does the architecture and design follow consistent guidelines for lua (like snake_case not camelCase for function name) or dot notation (self has to be explicit) and colon notation (self is assumed) 
    - Do other script examples follow similar guidelines for standard conventions in javascript or python in the architecture document
    - do you need to do external research/web research for this question?
    - How does the `/docs/technical/rs-llmspell-complete-architecture.md` need to change? 
    - does the change require changes to what was accomplished in `/doc/in-progress/PHASE*-DONE.md` what and how so?
    - does the change require changes to subsequent phases as documented in `/doc/in-progress/implementation-phases.md`, what and how so?
    - [x] Answer: 
        - YES, the architecture follows correct language conventions: Lua uses snake_case and colon notation, JavaScript uses camelCase and dot notation, Python uses snake_case and dot notation
        - Lua: Properties/params use `snake_case`, instance methods use colon notation `agent:execute()`, static methods use `Agent.create()`
        - JavaScript: Properties/params use `camelCase`, all methods use dot notation `agent.execute()`, static methods use `Agent.create()`
        - Python: Properties/params use `snake_case`, all methods use dot notation `agent.execute()`, static methods use `Agent.create()`
        - All languages consistently use PascalCase for type names (Agent, Tool, Workflow)
        - External research not needed - the document has many examples following proper conventions
        - The architecture document does NOT need changes - it already follows correct conventions
        - Phase 1 implementation correctly follows these conventions (verified in the Lua API injection)
        - No changes needed to subsequent phases - conventions are already correct
    - [x] Todo: 
        - [x] No changes needed - conventions are already correct
        - [x] Ensure Phase 5 (JavaScript) and Phase 6 (Python) follow the established patterns when implemented
