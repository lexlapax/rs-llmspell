# Task 3.1.8: Integration Testing Suite Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
1. **Test Files**: 13 individual tool integration tests + basic validation tests
2. **Mock Framework**: `llmspell-testing` crate with MockAgent, MockTool, etc.
3. **Test Patterns**: Consistent use of `create_test_context()` and real API endpoints
4. **Feature Flags**: Tools use conditional compilation for mocking (e.g., EmailSenderTool)

### Philosophy
Per CLAUDE.md: "NEVER implement a mock mode for testing. We always use real data and real APIs, never mock implementations."

## Implementation Strategy

Given the existing infrastructure and the project's philosophy, our approach will be:

### 1. Enhance Test Utilities (Not Mock Services)
Instead of creating mock services, we'll:
- Create a shared test utilities module to reduce duplication
- Standardize test data fixtures
- Build helper functions for common test scenarios

### 2. Real Service Test Harness
For external integrations:
- Use real services where possible (httpbin.org, public APIs)
- Use feature flags for conditional responses when services aren't available
- Create test accounts/sandboxes for services that require authentication

### 3. Error Scenario Testing
- Network failure simulation using invalid endpoints
- Rate limit testing using our new rate limiter
- Circuit breaker testing with our new implementation
- Timeout scenarios with controlled delays

### 4. Performance Benchmarking
- Use Rust's built-in benchmark framework
- Measure tool initialization time (<10ms requirement)
- Track response times for external calls
- Monitor memory usage patterns

### 5. Security Validation
- Input sanitization tests (already exist for some tools)
- Path traversal prevention (already tested)
- Command injection prevention (already tested)
- API key security (using our new key manager)

## Tools Requiring Integration Tests

### External Integration Tools (Phase 3.1)
1. ✅ WebSearchTool - Has tests, needs enhancement
2. ✅ EmailSenderTool - Has conditional mock via features
3. ✅ DatabaseConnectorTool - Has conditional support
4. ⚠️ ApiTesterTool - Needs tests
5. ⚠️ WebScraperTool - Needs tests
6. ⚠️ UrlAnalyzerTool - Needs tests
7. ⚠️ WebhookCallerTool - Needs tests
8. ⚠️ WebpageMonitorTool - Needs tests
9. ⚠️ SitemapCrawlerTool - Needs tests

## Next Steps

1. **Create Test Utilities Module**
   - Extract common helpers from existing tests
   - Create standardized test fixtures
   - Build error simulation utilities

2. **Complete Missing Integration Tests**
   - Focus on the 6 web tools without tests
   - Use httpbin.org and other public test services
   - Follow existing test patterns

3. **Enhance Error Testing**
   - Add circuit breaker integration
   - Test rate limiting scenarios
   - Simulate various failure modes

4. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Create benchmark suite for all tools
   - Establish baseline metrics
   - Set up CI performance tracking

5. **Security Test Suite**
   - Consolidate security tests
   - Add new API key security tests
   - Test rate limiting and circuit breaker security
