})

RAG.search({
    query = "What is the capital of France?",
    k = 10,
    threshold = 0.7,
    scope = "tenant-123"
})

RAG.get_stats("default", nil)  -- Get usage statistics
```

### 4. Storage Backend Integration

## Integration Points for Phase 9

### 1. Graph Storage Integration
**Key Areas**:
- **Bridge System**: Add Graph global as 18th global through existing infrastructure
- **Vector + Graph**: Combine vector similarity with graph relationships
- **Shared ComponentIds**: Use existing ComponentId system for graph nodes
- **State Integration**: Leverage StateManager for graph persistence

**Recommended Approach**:
```rust
// Phase 9 can extend existing VectorEntry
pub struct GraphEnhancedEntry {
    vector_entry: VectorEntry,
    graph_relationships: Vec<GraphRelation>,
    temporal_metadata: TemporalMetadata,
}
```

### 2. Multi-Tenant Graph Isolation
**Extension Points**:
- Extend `TenantManager` to include graph namespaces
- Add graph-specific resource quotas
- Track graph traversal costs separately
- Maintain tenant isolation for graph data

### 3. Session-Based Graph State
**Integration Strategy**:
- Store graph queries in session artifacts
- Track graph traversal history
- Cache frequently accessed graph paths
- Maintain conversation context with graphs

### 4. Performance Monitoring
**Critical Metrics to Preserve**:
- RAG vector search must remain <10ms
- Bridge globals injection <25% increase acceptable
- Memory usage <25% increase acceptable
- Session operations <15% slower acceptable

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Embedding Dimensions**: Fixed set (256-4096), not arbitrary
2. **Local Models**: BGE-M3 integration incomplete (using mock)
3. **Graph Preparation**: Placeholder interfaces only (Phase 9 work)
4. **Batch Size**: Limited to 100 documents per ingestion
5. **Provider Fallback**: Manual switching, not automatic

### Technical Debt
1. **Dimension Router**: Could be more efficient with compile-time selection
2. **Cache Eviction**: LRU only, could add TTL-based eviction
3. **Error Recovery**: Some edge cases in multi-tenant scenarios
4. **Monitoring**: Metrics collection could be more comprehensive

### Performance Considerations
1. **Memory Growth**: Monitor with large vector counts (>10M)
2. **Tenant Scaling**: Tested with 100 tenants, may need tuning for 1000+
3. **Concurrent Access**: Write locks may bottleneck at high concurrency
4. **Index Rebuilding**: HNSW rebuild is expensive for large datasets

## Migration Guide for Phase 9

### Adding Graph Storage

1. **Create `llmspell-graph` crate**:
```toml
[package]
name = "llmspell-graph"
version = "0.9.0"

[dependencies]
llmspell-core = { path = "../llmspell-core" }
llmspell-rag = { path = "../llmspell-rag" }  # Reuse vector infrastructure
petgraph = "0.6"  # Graph algorithms
```

2. **Extend Bridge System**:
```rust
// In llmspell-bridge/src/globals/graph_global.rs
pub struct GraphGlobal {
    rag_integration: Arc<RAGBridge>,
    graph_store: Arc<GraphStore>,
}
```

3. **Integrate with RAG**:
```rust
// Combined vector + graph search
pub async fn hybrid_search(
    vector_query: VectorQuery,
    graph_query: GraphQuery,
) -> Result<HybridResults> {
    let vector_results = self.rag.search(vector_query).await?;
    let graph_results = self.graph.traverse(graph_query).await?;
    merge_results(vector_results, graph_results)
}
```

### Benchmark Suite
```bash
# Run Phase 8 benchmarks for baseline
cargo bench -p llmspell-bridge --bench rag_bench

- vector_search: Must remain <10ms
- document_ingestion: Must remain <100ms  
- filtered_search: Overhead acceptable
- concurrent_operations: Scale linearly
```

## Performance Baselines for Phase 9

### Critical Baselines Established
```
Core System:
- ComponentId generation: ~85ns
- Serialization: nanosecond range

Bridge System (MOST CRITICAL):
- Global injection: 17 globals currently
- RAG integration: <10ms search
- Lua/Rust bridge: minimal overhead

RAG System:
- Vector search: 2-8ms depending on size
- Ingestion: 30-50ms per document
- Multi-tenant overhead: 2-3%
```

### Regression Testing
```bash
# After Phase 9 implementation, run:
./scripts/phase-9-regression-check.sh

# This will automatically:
- Compare against Phase 8 baselines
- Alert if thresholds exceeded
- Generate regression report
- Fail CI if regressions detected
```

2. **Leverage Bridge System**: Add Graph global through existing infrastructure
3. **Maintain Performance**: Use established baselines as guardrails
4. **Extend Multi-Tenancy**: Apply same isolation patterns to graphs

### Implementation Priority
1. **Week 1**: Create `llmspell-graph` crate structure
2. **Week 1**: Define graph storage traits
3. **Week 2**: Implement basic graph operations

5. **Week 3**: Add Graph global to bridge
6. **Week 3**: Implement multi-tenant graph isolation
7. **Week 4**: Performance optimization

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Performance Risk**: Monitor RAG degradation closely
2. **Memory Risk**: Graph structures can be memory-intensive
3. **Complexity Risk**: Keep graph features modular
