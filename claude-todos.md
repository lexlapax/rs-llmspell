# Claude TODO List for Task 7.1.8

## Completed Tasks ✅

1. [x] **Analysis & Discovery for workflow patterns** (high priority) - COMPLETED
   - Analyzed existing workflow patterns and bridge implementation
   - Discovered need for execution management beyond simple trait implementation
   - Identified integration requirements with existing factory from 7.1.7

2. [x] **Create WorkflowExecutor interface** (high priority) - COMPLETED
   - Created comprehensive `executor.rs` with WorkflowExecutor trait
   - Implemented execution management with cancellation and metrics
   - Added ExecutionHook trait for lifecycle monitoring
   - Created DefaultWorkflowExecutor with full async support

3. [x] **Bridge Integration with factory/executor** (high priority) - COMPLETED
   - Created `standardized_workflows.rs` to integrate factory from 7.1.7
   - Updated WorkflowBridge to use StandardizedWorkflowFactory
   - Maintained backward compatibility for all existing APIs
   - Renamed create_workflow to create_from_type_json for clarity

4. [x] **Standardize factory method naming** (medium priority) - COMPLETED
   - Aligned workflow factory methods with agent factory pattern
   - Added create_from_type() convenience method
   - Renamed bridge method to create_from_type_json() for JSON params
   - Ensured consistency across all factory implementations

5. [x] **Test implementation with categorization** (high priority) - COMPLETED
   - Created 28 comprehensive tests across 3 test files
   - All tests properly categorized with cfg_attr attributes
   - Tests cover executor functionality, factory integration, and end-to-end lifecycle
   - All tests compile successfully (with cfg_attr syntax warnings)

6. [x] **Update TODO.md with completion details** (medium priority) - COMPLETED
   - Updated Task 7.1.8 status to COMPLETED ✅
   - Marked all implementation steps as completed
   - Added comprehensive summary of implementation
   - Documented all files created/updated
